<hr />

<p>In the year 1815 Monseigneur Charles-François-Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop of Digne. He was then about seventy-five, having held the bishopric since 1806.</p>

<p>Although it has no direct bearing on the tale we have to tell, we must nevertheless give some account of the rumours and gossip concerning him which were in circulation when he came to occupy the diocese. What is reported of men, whether it be true or false, may play as large a part in their lives, and above all in their destiny, as the things they do. Monseigneur Myriel was the son of a counsellor of the Parliament of Aix, a member of the <em>noblesse de robe</em>. It was said of him that his father, intending him to inherit his office, had arranged for him to marry at a very early age, about eighteen or twenty, following the custom that was fairly widespread in parliamentary families. Charles Myriel, it was said, had attracted much gossip despite this marriage. He was good-looking although of small stature, elegant, graceful, and entertaining; his early life was wholly devoted to worldly matters and affairs of gallantry. Then had come the revolution, and in the rush of those events the decimated and persecuted parliamentary families had been scattered. Charles Myriel emigrated to Italy, and here his wife died of the chest complaint that had long afflicted her. There were no children. What happened after this to Monseigneur Myriel? Did the collapse of the old French social order, the downfall of his own family, the tragic events of ’93 – perhaps even more fearful to an <em>émigré</em> witnessing them at a distance – inspire in him thoughts of renunciation and solitude? Amid the distractions and frivolities that occupied his life, did it happen that he was suddenly overtaken by one of those mysterious and awful revulsions which, striking to the heart, change the nature of a man who cannot be broken by outward disasters affecting his life and fortune? No one can say. All that is known is that when he returned from Italy he was a priest.</p>

<p>In 1804 M. Myriel was curé of Brignolles, where, already elderly, he lived in profound seclusion.</p>

<p>At the time of the Emperor’s coronation, some small matter of parish business took him to Paris. Among the influential personages whom he had occasion to visit was Cardinal Fesch, the uncle of Napoleon, and it happened one day, when he was waiting in the cardinal’s antechamber, that the Emperor passed through on his way to call on his uncle. Seeing the old priest intently regarding him, he turned to him and asked sharply:</p>

<p>‘Who is the gentleman who is staring at me?’</p>

<p>‘Sire,’ replied M. Myriel, ‘you are looking at a plain man and I am looking at a great man. Each of us may benefit.’</p>

<p>That evening the Emperor asked the cardinal the priest’s name, and shortly afterwards M. Myriel learned to his great surprise that he had been appointed Bishop of Digne.</p>

<p>As to the truth in general of the tales that were told about the early life of M. Myriel, no one could vouch for it. Few people remained who had known his family before the revolution. He had to accept the fate of every newcomer to a small town where there are plenty of tongues that gossip and few minds that think. He had to bear with this in spite of being a bishop and because he was a bishop. And after all, these tales were perhaps only tales, rumour and fabrication and nothing more.</p>

<p>However that may be, by the ninth year of his residence as Bishop of Digne all the chatter that at first occupies small people in small places had died down and been forgotten. No one would have presumed to refer to it or even to remember it.</p>

<p>M. Myriel had come to Digne accompanied by his sister, Mademoiselle Baptistine, an unmarried woman ten years younger than himself. Their only servant was Madame Magloire, a woman of the same age as Mlle Baptistine, who, from having been the servant of M. le Curé, now assumed the twofold office of personal maid to Mademoiselle and housekeeper to Monseigneur.</p>

<p>Mlle Baptistine was tall, pale, thin and gentle, a perfect expression of all that is implied by the word ‘respectable’: for it seems that a woman must become a mother before she can be termed ‘venerable’. She had never been pretty. Her life, which had been wholly occupied with good works, had endowed her with a kind of pallor and luminosity, and as she grew older she had acquired what may be called the beauty of goodness. What had been skinniness in her youth had become, as she matured, a quality of transparency through which her saintly nature could be seen to shine. She was a spirit more than she was a virgin. Her being seemed composed of shadow, with too little substance for it to possess sex. It was a shred of matter harbouring a light, with large eyes that were always cast down; a pretext for a soul to linger on earth.</p>

<p>Mme Magloire was a small, plump, white-haired old woman, always busy and always breathless, partly because of her incessant activity and also because she suffered from asthma.</p>

<p>Upon his arrival in Digne M. Myriel was installed in the bishop’s palace with the honours prescribed by the imperial decree, which ranked a bishop immediately below a Marshal of France. The Mayor and the President of the Council were the first dignitaries to call upon him, and his own first visits were paid to the General and the prefect.</p>

<p>His installation over, the town waited to see their new bishop at work.</p>
