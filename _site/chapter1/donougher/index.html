    <p>In 1815, Charles-François-Bienvenu Myriel was bishop of Digne. He was an old man of about seventy-five. He had been bishop of Digne since 1806.</p>

<p>If only for the sake of being accurate in every particular, although this circumstance in no way impinges on the basic substance of what we are about to relate, it may be worth mentioning here the rumours and gossip circulating about him at the time of his arrival in the diocese. True or false, what is said about men often figures as large in their lives, and above all in the fate that befalls them, as what they do. Monsieur Myriel was the son of a councillor in the parliament at Aix<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> – judicial aristocracy.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> It was reported that his father, intending that his son should inherit his position, had married him off very young, aged eighteen or twenty, a fairly common practice among parliamentary families. This marriage, it was said, did not prevent Charles Myriel from being much talked about. He was good-looking, though rather short in stature, elegant, charming, witty. His entire early life was devoted to fashionable society and amorous intrigue. The Revolution came. Events moved fast. Decimated, driven out, hunted down, the parliamentary families scattered. During the very first days of the Revolution, Monsieur Charles Myriel emigrated to Italy. There, his wife died of a chest ailment that had long afflicted her. They had no children. What then happened to Monsieur Myriel? The collapse in France of the old world, the downfall of his own family, the tragic spectacles of ’93,<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> perhaps even more terrifying for the émigrés watching from afar with magnifying horror – did these give rise in him to thoughts of renunciation and solitude? Was he, in the midst of one of those distractions and attachments that filled his existence, suddenly dealt one of those mysterious and terrible blows that by striking at the heart sometimes fell a man who would be left unshaken by public catastrophes that strike at his way of life and his fortune? No one could have said. All anyone knew was that when he returned from Italy he was a priest.</p>

<p>In 1804 Monsieur Myriel was parish priest of Brignolles. He was already old, and lived a very secluded life.</p>

<p>Around the time of the coronation<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> some parish matter, no one quite knows what any more, took him to Paris. Among other influential individuals that he applied to on behalf of his parishioners was Cardinal Fesch.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> The worthy priest happened to be waiting in the antechamber one day when the emperor had come to visit his uncle. As Napoleon was on his way out, realizing he was being observed with some curiosity by this elderly gentleman, his majesty turned round and said abruptly, ‘What good fellow is this, staring at me?’</p>

<p>‘Sire,’ said Monsieur Myriel, ‘in this fellow you see goodness, in the man before me I see greatness. There’s advantage to both of us.’</p>

<p>That same evening the emperor enquired of the cardinal the name of the priest, and some time afterwards Monsieur Myriel was very surprised to learn he had been appointed bishop of Digne.</p>

<p>Anyway, what truth was there in the stories told of Monsieur Myriel’s early life? No one could tell. Few families had known the Myriel family before the Revolution.</p>

<p>Monsieur Myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer to a small town where there are plenty of tongues given to wagging and very few minds given to reflection. He had to be subjected to it although he was a bishop and because he was a bishop. But the rumours his name was associated with were after all perhaps just that: rumours, idle gossip, talk, empty words, not even words – <em>palabres</em>,<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> in the muscular language of the south.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, after Monsieur Myriel had been living in Digne and serving as bishop for nine years, all this tittle-tattle, these topics of conversation that give small towns and small-minded people something to talk about, had been thoroughly forgotten. No one would have dared mention them, no one would even have dared call them to mind.</p>

<p>Monsieur Myriel had arrived in Digne accompanied by a spinster, Mademoiselle Baptistine, who was his sister and ten years his junior.</p>

<p>Their only domestic help was a woman of the same age as Mademoiselle Baptistine called Madame Magloire, who, having been ‘monsieur le curé’s servant’, now acquired the dual status of Mademoiselle’s maid and Monseigneur’s housekeeper.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Mademoiselle Baptistine was long, pale, slight and meek. She was the perfect incarnation of the word ‘respectable’, for apparently a woman must be motherly to be venerable. She had never been pretty. Her whole life, which had been simply a succession of good deeds, had ultimately conferred on her a sort of paleness and brightness, and with advancing years she had gained what might be called the beauty of goodness. What had been thinness in her youth became transparency in her maturity, and this diaphanous quality revealed the angel. She was more of an essence than a virgin. Physically, she seemed to be made of shadow with hardly enough of a body to have any sexual identity: a little substance containing a glimmer of light, her big eyes always downcast, an excuse for a soul to remain on earth.</p>

<p>Madame Magloire was a busy, fat, round, little white-haired old woman, always out of breath, firstly because of her busyness and then because of her asthma.</p>

<p>On his arrival, Monsieur Myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with the honours dictated by imperial decree whereby a bishop ranks immediately below a brigadier. The mayor and the president of the local judiciary first called on him, and he in turn made his first call on the general and the police chief.</p>

<p>His installation complete, the town waited to see what the bishop would do.</p>

      <p>the parliament at Aix: The Provence parliament, dating from 1501 and based in Aix-en-Provence, was the chief judiciary authority and highest court in Provence. Bastions of privilege associated with the <em>ancien régime</em>, all the provincial parliaments and the Paris parliament were abolished in the early days of the Revolution. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>judicial aristocracy: Before the French Revolution the French aristocracy who owed their rank to their military service were known as the <em>noblesse d’épée</em>, ‘the nobility of the sword’, while those who were ennobled because of their judicial or administrative position were the <em>noblesse de robe</em>, ‘nobility of the robe’, or ‘gown’. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>the tragic spectacles of ’93: Louis XVI was executed on 21 January, Marie-Antoinette on 16 October. The Terror implemented by the Revolutionary government’s Committee of Public Safety began in September and continued until the fall of Robespierre in July 1794. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Cardinal Fesch: Joseph Fesch (1763–1839), an uncle of Napoleon, was named archbishop of Lyon in 1802 and created cardinal in 1803; Napoleon appointed him ambassador to Rome that same year. <a href="#fnref:5" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p><em>palabres</em>: Now commonly used in modern French to mean ‘interminable discussions’, etymologically and historically the word derives from the Spanish <em>palabra</em> (‘word’), which entered French usage as a result of contacts with Africans who had previously traded with the Spanish. The word came to be associated with notoriously lengthy ritual gift-presentation ceremonies. Hence its southern connotations. <a href="#fnref:6" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
