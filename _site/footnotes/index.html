</h5>
    
<p>St Benedict of Nursia (c.480–c.547) is generally recognized as the founder of Western monasticism, and his Rule is a detailed guide to how the religious life should be observed and regulated. He himself founded a number of monasteries, including the one at Monte Cassino, where he died. In 1098 St Robert (c.1028–1111), abbot de Molesme, founded a monastery at Cîteaux near Dijon, where it was intended the Rule of St Benedict would be rigorously observed. This community became known as members of the Cistercian Order, and was joined in 1112 by St Bernard (1090–1153), who in 1115 was sent forth by the abbot to found a new house. Bernard founded the monastery at Clairvaux with which he is identified and where the monastic tradition was reformed and revived.</p>

<p>There is a French proverb: ‘Quand le diable devient vieux, il se fait ermite’ (‘When the devil grows old, he becomes a hermit’). In other words, a misspent youth is often followed by a pious old age.</p>

</h5>
    
<p>St Gregory the Great (c.540–604; from 590 Pope Gregory I) tells us in his account of St Benedict’s life (<em>Dialogues</em>, bk 2) that as an aspiring servant of God, Benedict fled from his home (more likely at about the age of nineteen or twenty) to ‘a desert place called Subiaco, almost forty miles distant from Rome’, where he lived as a hermit, devoting himself to prayer and to overcoming the temptations of the flesh. After a number of years, probably in about 529, he went to Monte Cassino, about eighty miles south of Rome, and there on the site of a temple to Apollo founded the monastery for which he wrote the Benedictine Rule.</p>

</h5>
    
<p>Founded by the Italian Filippo de’ Neri (1515–95), the Congregation of the Oratory received papal recognition in 1575. It is an institution consisting of autonomous communities of priests bound not by monastic vows but by those of the priesthood only, and devoted to prayer and preaching and the celebration of the sacraments. Filippo de’ Neri refused a cardinalship (offered by Gregory XIV) and was canonized in 1622. In 1611 Cardinal Pierre de Bérulle (1575–1629) founded a new Congregation in France, recognized by a papal bull in 1613, and differing from the Italian institution mostly in that the houses came under the overall authority of a superior-general and a general assembly. The Oratory was founded in England in 1847 by John Henry Newman (1801–90), cardinal from 1879.</p>

<p>i.e., Cistercians, among the strictest of monastic orders. As Hugo explains, the monastery of Cîteaux, and thus the Cistercian order, was founded in 1098 by Saint Robert de Molesme, who wanted to reestablish strict obedience to the monastic rules laid down by Saint Benedict (ca. 480–ca. 547), the founder of the Western tradition of monasticism. Robert was eclipsed by the prestige of his successor as abbot of Cîteaux, Saint Bernard (1090–1138), who founded a number of filial abbeys, most notably Clairvaux. As Hugo indicates, a number of medieval religious orders were founded as an attempt to return to the original rule of Saint Benedict.</p>

<p>Hugo seems to be playing on the old French proverb “When the devil gets old, he’ll become a monk.” One of the abbeys Saint Benedict founded is the famous abbey of Monte Cassino, previously the site of a pagan temple dedicated to Apollo.</p>

Suppressed during the Revolution, it became in 1801 the Palais des Beaux-Arts, and in 1805 the home of the Institut de France. The Théâtre Feydeau merged in 1801 with the Opéra-Comique, which then moved to the Salle Feydeau, where it continued to stage performances as the Opéra-Comique until 1829.</p>

<p>The formula is taken from ‘an ordinance issued in 1245 by Eudes [Odo] de Châteauroux … canon and chancellor of Notre-Dame’ (he was also papal legate to France in 1245), prohibiting outsiders – including the mothers and sisters of the nuns – from staying overnight within the cloister of Notre-Dame, unless they are great ladies <em>quae sine scandolo evitari non possint</em>’, and cited in <em>The History of Paris from the Earliest Period to the Present Day</em>, London: Whitaker and Galignani, 1825, vol. 1, p. 32.<br />
Citing an ordinance of 1207 by ‘the legate Odo’, Hugo uses this formula in fuller detail in The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (bk IV, ch. 5): ‘aliquae magnates mulieres, quae sine scandolo evitari non possunt’ (some great ladies who cannot be refused without scandal).</p>

Yves Gohin attributes this scene to Hugo’s love of reading dictionaries, in this case Louis Moreri’s <em>Catholic Encyclopaedia</em>, first published in 1649. Several of the authorities and examples Mother Innocent cites are erroneous or simply inventions of Hugo’s. Old man Fauchelevent’s uncomprehending goodwill (“Me neither”) toward Merlonus Horstius confirms Hugo’s lighthearted touch in this scene, in which one can see the hand of Hugo the playwright.</p>

The eldest was Louis-Philippe, who inherited the title Duc d’Orléans when his father was guillotined in 1793 and was king of France from 1830 to 1848. Madame de Genlis also made a name for herself as a prolific writer. She wrote historical and pedagogical novels (one of which, <em>Adelaide and Theodore</em> in the English translation, is mentioned in Jane Austen’s Emma, 1816), and received an honorary degree from Oxford University. The journal <em>L’Intrépide</em>, in which her intention, as she says in her memoirs, was to correct grammar mistakes made in the daily newspapers, did not survive beyond the first issue in 1820.</p>

During the Revolution, she emigrated to England, where she supported herself by writing novels. She entered her “ferociously devout phase” on returning to France in 1800.

<p>Hugo has used in this paragraph names connected with his own life: Julienne Gauvain, better known as Juliette Drouet (1806–83), was his mistress and devoted companion from 1833 until her death. During the Peninsular War, Hugo’s father was made general and governor of the central provinces of Spain and given the title count by the then king of Spain Joseph Bonaparte. Cogolludo, Cifuentes and Sigüenza are all towns located in the Spanish central province of Guadalajar, which came under General Hugo’s governorship. Hugo’s maternal grandfather was born at Auvergné near Nantes; Hugo wrote some of his early articles under the name d’Auverney, and gave the name Auverney to one of the main characters in his first novel, <em>Bug-Jargal</em>, written when he was sixteen. La Miltière is the country estate of which l’Audinière was a smaller part, bought by General Hugo and his second wife in 1823, and is where Victor Hugo’s first child, Léopold, who died aged three months, was buried. ‘Suzette et Suzon’ is a poem by Hugo, published posthumously in the collection <em>Toute la Lyre</em> (1888 and 1893) and set to music by Saint-Saëns.</p>

<p>#####‘What a devil of a noise!’:
In the French text, ‘C’est le diable à quatre’. With Madame de Genlis’s signature four rings in mind, Hugo here is playing on the expression <em>faire le diable à quatre,</em> meaning ‘to create a great deal of noise and disorder’ and said to derive from medieval morality plays featuring four characters – the devil and his lieutenants.</p>

She too was executed. Byron alludes to her story in <em>Childe Harold</em> (canto 3, stanza 66) and in a footnote gives a fuller version of the epitaph: <em>Julia Alpinula / Hic jaceo / Infelicis patris infelix proles / Deae Aventiae Sacerdos / Exorare patris necem non potui / Male mori in fatis illi erat / Vixi annos XXIII</em> (‘Julia Alpinula / here I lie / unhappy child of an unhappy father / priestess of the goddess Aventia / I could not avert my father’s death by entreaty / he was doomed to die by violence / I lived twenty-three years.’) Byron comments: ‘I know of no human composition so affecting as this; nor a history of deeper interest: these are names and actions which ought not to perish …’ Even in 1846 the epitaph was considered a forgery and there is no evidence that Julia Alpinula ever existed.</p>

In his <em>Account of the Death of the Chevalier de la Barre</em> (1766) he protested against the exposure of crucifixes and religious images on public highways, rather than in the churches where in his view they more properly belonged. In 1761, Voltaire had taken up the case of the Huguenot merchant Jean Calas of Toulouse, who was found guilty of murdering his son in order to prevent or punish his conversion to Catholicism, for which Calas was tortured and executed. As a result of Voltaire’s involvement in the campaign to clear his name, the case was reviewed. The conviction was overturned and the family was paid compensation. In his <em>Treatise on Tolerance</em> (1763; ch. 23) Voltaire addresses a prayer to an all-embracing God: ‘que les petites différences entre les vêtements qui couvrent nos débiles corps, entre tous nos langages insuffisants, entre tous nos usages ridicules, entre toutes nos lois imparfaites, entre toutes nos opinions insensées, entre toutes nos conditions si disproportionnées à nos yeux, et si égales devant toi; que toutes ces petites nuances qui distinguent les atomes appelés <em>hommes</em> ne soient pas des signaux de haine et de persécution’ (‘that the slight differences in the garments that cover our frail bodies, in our insufficient languages, in our ridiculous customs, in our imperfect laws, in our unreasonable opinions, in all our conditions, so incomparable in our eyes and so equal before you; that all these small distinctions that differentiate the atoms called men be not signals for hatred and persecution’).</p>

<p>In 1762 a Huguenot couple named Sirven, accused of murdering their daughter because she wanted to become a Catholic, escaped to Switzerland to avoid arrest. They were sentenced to death in absentia, and all their assets confiscated. Voltaire took up their cause, and eventually their conviction was overthrown.</p>

<p><em>The affaire Calas</em> was a criminal trial in which a Protestant, Jean Calas, was convicted of the murder of his son in spite of inconclusive evidence. In Toulouse, where relations between Catholics and Protestants remained hostile well into the nineteenth century, Calas was suspected of having wanted to stop his son from converting to Catholicism. Calas was executed in 1762, but Voltaire was able to have his conviction posthumously overturned three years later.</p>

He was condemned to have his hand cut off and his tongue cut out before being burned at the stake; on appeal the sentence was reduced to simple decapitation. Voltaire (among others) fought in vain to stop his execution, which was the last for a charge of blasphemy under the ancien régime. The Sirvens, husband and wife, were accused of murdering their daughter in order to prevent her from converting to Catholicism. In this case, the couple fled to Switzerland before being arrested and were condemned to death in absentia. Voltaire succeeded in his efforts to have their sentence overturned.</p>

As his armies starved the city by siege, the beautiful and pious widow Judith made her way to his tent, seduced him, and gave him wine until he fell asleep, at which point she cut off his head, which she carried back to Jerusalem in triumph. The story of Judith and Holofernes inspired painters from Rembrandt to Klimt and several operas.</p>

<p>Caiaphas was the Jewish high priest who presided over the court that sought evidence against Christ in order to put him to death (Matthew 26:57–68). He appears in medieval passion plays dressed as a bishop. Draco, the Athenian legislator of the seventh century BC, established a legal code that was considered particularly harsh, with the death penalty prescribed for even minor offences – hence the term ‘draconian’. A debauched parvenu of immense wealth and no morals, Trimalchio is a character in the satirical novel <em>Satyricon</em> by the first-century-AD Latin author Petronius. The Roman emperor Tiberius (42 BC–AD 37) is portrayed by the historian Tacitus (56–117) as crafty, cruel, licentious and unprincipled.</p>

<p>Caiaphus was the high priest of Jerusalem at the time of Christ’s trial; he continued to persecute early Christians after the Crucifixion. Draco, the Athenian ruler (seventh century B.C.E.), is remembered as the creator of unreasonably harsh laws. The adjective draconian derives from his name. Trimalcion was from the <em>Satyricon</em> of the first-century Roman author Petronius; Trimalcion, or Trimalchio, is a pompous nouveau riche Roman who flaunts his wealth and his shallow understanding of literature and philosophy. Trimalcion as “lawmaker” or legislator recalls the senator of Part One, and would have had great resonance for readers of France under the July Monarchy and the Second Empire. Tiberius (42 B.C.E.–A.D. 37) succeeded Caesar Augustus as Roman emperor (14–37). His reign was marked by the execution of political enemies and legendary debauchery on the island of Capri.</p>

We are all compelled to go there, a turn of the urn determines the fate of all and sooner or later imposes on us embarkation for eternal exile’). Founded in 1140, the monastery of La Trappe acquired its modern reputation for austerity in the late seventeenth century under the rule of Armand de Rance (1626–1700), nominally abbot from a very young age. For many years he led a dissolute life, but he underwent a conversion in the late 1650s and introduced a strict ascetic rule with which the name of the reformed Cistercian monastery is now synonymous. It was an erroneous popular belief that the monks of La Trappe greeted each other with the words ‘Memento mori’ and that they daily dug their own graves.</p>

Leibniz defended prayers as useful ‘because the idea or the foreknowledge of our prayers aided the divine understanding when it arranged the universe’ (Lloyd Strickland, <em>The Shorter Leibniz Texts: A Collection of New Translations</em>, London: Continuum, 2006, p. 102).</p>

<p>The German mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716) was a rationalist and firm believer in God. In <em>Candide</em> (1756), Voltaire made Dr. Pangloss the satirically reductive voice of Leibniz’s philosophical optimism in “this the best of all possible worlds.” The deist Voltaire believed in the “watchmaker god” who had created a brilliant machine but was indifferent to its operations, including prayer.</p>

<p>“A monument to God, erected by Voltaire,” the inscription on the church Voltaire had built in the village of Ferney (see here). Whatever his hostility to politicized religious institutions such as the Catholic Church (the object of his legendary motto <em>“Écrasez l’Infame,”</em> “Crush the Infamous One”), he believed that religion was necessary to provide moral guidance to the masses. He also promoted such cottage industries as pottery and watchmaking in Ferney, as work was also necessary to social order. It is worth noting that Voltaire’s church is dedicated to God, not to any religion or saint.</p>

<p>At the Council of Sens (1140), the writings and teachings of the scholastic philosopher and theologian Peter Abelard (1079–1142), challenged by Bernard of Clairvaux, were condemned as heretical, and in consequence Abelard was sentenced to monastic isolation. Pierre de Bruys was burned as a heretic in 1126 and his disciple Henry of Lausanne was arrested in 1145/6 and sentenced to life imprisonment. Apostolicals is a designation loosely applied to a twelfth-century heretical grouping with pretensions to an apostolic way of life. Abelard’s disciple Arnold of Brescia (c.1100–c.1155) was eventually executed in Rome. Bernard deplored the anti-Jewish violence to which a Cistercian monk, Radulf, incited the population in the Rhineland at the time of the Second Crusade (1145–9), and took measures to curtail his activities. Gilbert de la Porée, bishop of Poitiers (1070–1154), was censured by the Council of Reims (1148) for some of his teachings about the Trinity, a judgement to which he bowed without protest. A self-appointed messiah, the Breton monk Éon de l’Étoile was deemed insane at the Council of Reims and sentenced to the seclusion of a monastery. Louis VII, known as Louis the Young (1120–80), was prevailed upon by St Bernard to join the Second Crusade (proclaimed by Pope Eugenius III in 1145, the year of his election to the papacy). The first Cistercian to become pope, Eugenius III (died 1153) presided over the Council of Reims. The rule of the Knights Templars, dating from the Council of Troyes in 1128, was inspired by St Bernard.</p>

Several of the authorities and examples Mother Innocent cites are erroneous or simply inventions of Hugo’s.

<p>It is recorded that the emperor Charles V (1500–58) developed a passion for a beautiful young woman, Eliodora de Plombes, from Ratisbon (Regensburg), who became his mistress at Cambrai in 1544; so enamoured of each other were they that she visited him, dressed as a man, while he was on military campaign (Gregorio Leti, <em>Vita dell’ Invittissimo Imperadore Carlo V</em>, 1700, vol. 3, pp. 157–60). In 1556 Charles abdicated, and retired to the monastery of San Yuste in Extremadura, Spain. Cristóbal de Castillejo (1491–1556) was a Spanish poet and monk, who served as secretary to Charles V’s brother Ferdinand. Austin Castillejo is probably an invention of Hugo.</p>

<p>At the height of his power, Charles V (1500–58), Holy Roman Emperor (1530–58) and King of Spain (1516–56), controlled Austria and much of Germany, the Low Countries, the Franche-Comté, much of Italy, and the Spanish possessions in the Americas. After his abdication in 1556 due to ill health—his Spanish possessions went to his son, Philip II of Spain, his German titles to his brother—Charles lived at the Spanish monastery of San Yuste, near Extremadura, Spain. The anecdote about a mistress named La Plombes, as well as its source, Austin Castillejo, are inventions of Hugo.</p>

<p>Opposition to the Revolution broke out in western France in the Vendée region and in Brittany from 1793, triggered by a levy of conscripts for the Republican army, which rallied peasant support for the royalist Catholic cause. In Brittany the counter-revolutionaries were known as the Chouans. Jean-Nicolas Stofflet (1751–96), major-general of the so-called Armée Catholique et Royale de Vendée, was captured and executed in 1796. This civil war is the subject of Hugo’s novel <em>Quatre-vingt-treize</em> (’93), published in 1874. It was also the subject of the first novel, entitled <em>Les Chouans</em> (1829), in Balzac’s <em>Human Comedy</em> cycle.</p>

<p>Anti-revolutionary activity was particularly strong in the west of France, in Bretagne and the Vendée region, which gave its name to the movement and its military forces, the Vendéens, or, as they called themselves, l’Armée Catholique et Royale de la France. Jean Nicolas Stofflet (1753–96), one of the leaders of the Vendéen movement, was captured and shot by government troops in 1796.</p>

Hugo’s last novel, <em>Ninety-three</em>, tells the story of a Chouan faction at war with the armies of the Convention.</p>
