</h5>
    
<p>Before his consecration by Hugo in the character of Gavroche, the Parisian gamin emerges as a social archetype, both celebrated and deplored by writers and illustrators, from 1830 and the July Revolution onwards. (See Jean-Jacques Yvorel, ‘De Delacroix à Poulbot, l’image du gamin de Paris’, <em>Revue d’histoire de l’enfance ‘irrégulière’</em>, no. 4 (2002), pp. 39–72, [http://rhei.revues.org/index52.html]</p>

</h5>
    
<p>In royal and princely courts of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, dwarves were frequently employed as fools or jesters and, according to classical tradition, used their status to point out the foibles of the mighty, as with Shakespeare’s fool in <em>King Lear</em>. The dwarf-jester Triboulet is the protagonist of Hugo’s play <em>Le Roi s’amuse</em> (The King Takes His Pleasure), which inspired Verdi’s <em>Rigoletto</em>.</p>

<p>The celebrated diplomat (see here) was as well known for his sharp wit in society as for his unscrupulous survival skills in politics.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The prince de Talleyrand … Louis serving him as deacon: Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord (1754–1838) was one of the legendary figures of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras; a great aristocrat, a one time bishop, a revolutionary politician, and above all a political survivor, Talleyrand served virtually every government from the Constituent Assembly through the July Monarchy, reaching the peak of his influence as foreign minister of France, first to Napoléon and then, having helped orchestrate the emperor’s downfall, to Louis XVIII. The Congress of Vienna was a triumph for Talleyrand before Napoléon’s return from Elba cost him his standing with the allies. On July 14, 1790, as bishop of Autun and one of the leading members of the Constituent Assembly, Talleyrand had officiated at a mass of celebration dedicated to the Federation of French citizens and their volunteer militias performed on the Champ de Mars. He was assisted in that mass by a priest named Abbé Joseph Louis (1755–1837). Thanks largely to Talleyrand’s protection, the abbé Louis, more interested in economics than theology, had a long career in government, serving as minister of finance under the Restoration and later for Louis-Philippe.</p>

  <p>Jeanne-Marguerite Salvetat (1779–1847), known as Mademoiselle Mars, was the leading actress of the Comédie-Française from 1803 on. Mademoiselle Mars was Napoléon’s favourite actress and briefly his mistress. Later in her career, she would play Doña Sol in Hugo’s Hernani (1830). (see here).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hernani”: With tongue in cheek, Hugo mocks the reaction to his own play of 1830, which was enormously controversial for its complete break with the traditions of French theatre (hence, “not even written in French!”). The antithesis was one of Hugo’s favourite literary devices.</p>

<p>not specific people but personifications of two types: Prudhomme, from “prudent man” (see here), the cautious, complacent, and self-satisfied man so typical of the French bourgeoisie of the July Monarchy and the Second Empire, and Fouillou, from the verb <em>fouiller</em>, “to search” or “to dig,” the resourceful and self-reliant—sometimes slippery—type, like Figaro.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prudhomme and <em>prudhommerie</em> came to refer to banal mediocrity in nineteenth-century France, following the writer and illustrator Henri Monnier’s hugely successful caricature of the 1830s. Monnier’s Monsieur Prudhomme was well intentioned but also pretentious, vain, and ignorant. Hugo refers to <em>prudhommerie</em> frequently in <em>Les Misérables</em>.</p>

<p>As with the list of suburban villages at the end of the chapter, many of these sites can still be seen on a map of Paris and its outskirts. Of special note is the “hideous Grenelle wall riddled with bullet holes.” The <em>mur de Grenelle</em>—a since-demolished vestige of the medieval defensive wall—was the site of military executions by firing squad. Besides Hugo’s lifelong abhorrence of the death penalty, this was the site and method of execution of General Lahorie, Hugo’s godfather and his mother’s lover, convicted of plotting against Napoléon in 1812.</p>

<p>The Sanson family held the office of public executioner from 1688 until 1847. Abbé Montès was chaplain of the Conciergerie prison, attending those condemned to death, including Pierre-François Lacenaire, who was executed for murder and theft in January 1836, together with his accomplice Victor Avril. While in prison Lacenaire wrote songs, poems and his memoirs (published after his death). He was reincarnated as the criminal poet dandy in Marcel Carné’s film <em>Les Enfants du Paradis</em>. For details of Lacenaire’s role model, the notorious murderer Dautun, see note p. 1315. Louis-Auguste Papavoine was executed in March 1825 for the murder of two children. Edmé-Henri-Charles Tolleron, an engraver, was found guilty of taking part in a seditious plot – orchestrated by agents provocateurs – against the Bourbon monarchy, and was executed in July 1816. François Delaporte was executed, together with two accomplices, in April 1824 for highway robbery. In <em>Victor Hugo raconté par un témoin de sa vie</em>, Hugo is said to have seen both Louvel (the Duc de Berry’s assassin) and the bald Delaporte (‘an old man’) on their way to execution (Louvel, in June 1820). Dr Edme-Samuel Castaing was executed in December 1823 for the murder of two brothers (of the first with the complicity of the second, who paid him handsomely for it). Jean-François-Louis-Clair Bories was one of the four young sergeants of La Rochelle (along with Pommier, Raoulx and Goubin) executed for sedition in September 1822, despite Bories’s attempt to exculpate his companions. Jean Martin is the name of a parricide referred to in <em>Victor Hugo raconté par un témoin de sa vie</em> as having been executed in 1825. In Hugo’s 1829 novel <em>Le Dernier jour d’un condamné</em>, written in protest against capital punishment, Jean Martin’s name appears on the wall of the narrator’s prison with the date 1821. However, the only parricide with a name bearing any resemblance to Jean Martin who died during this period of whom there is any record was thirty-three-year-old Pierre-Martin Godefroy, executed along with his brother in 1820 for the murder of their father in 1815. Lecouffé and his mother were executed in January 1824 for the murder of an old woman carried out by Lecouffé at his mother’s instigation. Philippe-François Debacker was executed in June 1829 for the murder of his mistress and her employer.</p>

    Lacenaire … Debacker: <a href="#lacenaire--debacker">#</a>
  
  
</h5>
    
<p>Like the rest of the criminals named in this chapter, Lacenaire was a real person. Pierre François Lacenaire (1803–36) was the well-educated son of a prosperous merchant in Lyon; arrested for two murders—and a third that he had attempted—Lacenaire managed to make himself a celebrity in prison, writing poetry and his memoirs before his execution was carried out. Hugo would have been thirteen when he saw Dautun executed for the  murder of his brother in 1816 (see here).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Charles Dautun murdered his brother in 1814 and was beheaded for it in 1816.
Papavoine was executed for murdering two children in the Bois de Vincennes. Tolleron was one of those executed in an 1816 plot to blow up the Tuileries Palace. Avril was Lacenaire’s friend and accomplice. Louvel assassinated the duc de Berry in 1820 (see here).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The duc de Berry was the younger son of the comte d’Artois. As the duchesse d’Angoulême, the wife of his elder brother and daughter of Louis XVI, was past childbearing age, the younger prince’s marriage was a matter of state concern. He was married to his distant cousin Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Sicile, daughter of the king of Naples and Sicily. The duc de Berry was assassinated at the Opéra by Louvel in 1820; the fact that his young wife was pregnant was taken by royalists as a sign of divine favour for the Bourbon monarchy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Delaporte was a highwayman executed in 1824; Castaing (1793–1824) murdered two of his friends in order to inherit their fortunes. Bories was one of four soldiers condemned to death for plotting a republican coup in the plot of the “Sergents de Rochelle.” Jean-Martin is a mistaken reference to Paul-Louis Martin, who was beheaded for murdering his father in 1820. Madame Lecouffé pushed her son to murder an old lady so that they could rob her. Castaing, Bories, Martin, Dautun, and Papavoine were mentioned in Hugo’s <em>Last Day of a Condemned Man</em>. The details of the criminal named Debacker are elusive.</p>

The Turkish <em>hamal</em>, bent double under his load, has his equivalent in the beefy market porter of Paris. The Neapolitan scoundrel, the <em>lazzarone</em> and the Parisian <em>pègre</em> are both members of a similarly low-class fraternity of petty criminals. What is common to the cockney, as understood by the French, and the <em>gandin</em> is a kind of Jack-the-lad, cock-of-the-walk, preening self-confidence.</p>

His father died when he was young and his mother squandered his inheritance, including the library, which had to be sold. Hugo refers to her here as the <em>poissarde</em>, a word that came to mean ‘fishwife’ but has the older meaning of ‘thief’ (apparently deriving from the word <em>poisse</em>, slime left on the hands and clothes of people who handle fish – see R.

<p>The Spanish Colonel Francisco Amóros (1770–1848) is credited with introducing the trapeze into France as part of his military gymnastic training programme. In the mid nineteenth century the acrobat Thévelin performed on a trapeze suspended from a balloon at the Hippodrome, and the trapeze act continued to evolve as part of the circus repertoire. The reference to Plautus’ trapeze is possibly a play on the Latin word <em>trapezita</em>, ‘banker’, of which there are many in Plautus’ plays, including <em>Curculio</em> (The Forgery).</p>

Unable to deal individually with the numbers who flocked to him, the legendary healer Anton Mesmer (1734–1815) developed the <em>baquet</em>, a kind of tub around which the patients sat to receive his therapy, based on his theory of animal magnetism. (The commission set up in 1784 to investigate this therapy was headed by Benjamin Franklin, then American ambassador to Paris.)</p>

He was eventually arrested by spies of the Inquisition and sentenced to death for being a freemason, although this sentence was apparently commuted to life imprisonment. He has enjoyed a long and varied afterlife in numerous literary and musical manifestations. Ergaphilas may be the Athenian general Ergophilus, who shared with Cagliostro the experience of escaping the death sentence (Aristotle, <em>Rhetoric</em>, 2.3.13: ‘For men grow mild when they have exhausted their anger upon another, as happened in the case of Ergophilus. For although the Athenians were more indignant with him than with Callisthenes, they acquitted him because they had condemned Callisthenes the day before.’)</p>

<p>On 20 June 1789 the self-declared National Assembly – which the king refused to recognize, also denying it entry to the place where it had previously met as the Third Estate in France’s parliamentary body, the Estates General – gathered in a nearby tennis court (<em>jeu de paume</em>), where its members took a vow that they would continue their meetings, as the National Constituent Assembly, until they had drawn up a new constitution.</p>

<p>The National Constituent Assembly interrupted its debate on the constitution so as to address the unrest that was spreading throughout France after the storming of the Bastille on 14 July. At the end of a sitting that went on through the night of 4 August, legislation was passed abolishing all feudal rights and privileges in the interests of equality, legitimacy and fairness.</p>

<p>Before he was elected first President of the United States, George Washington (1732–99) was appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War (1775–83). Tadeusz Kosciuszko (1746–1817) was leader of the 1794 uprising against Imperial Russia and the Kingdom of Prussia, having previously served as colonel in the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War. Markos Botsaris (1788–1823) was a Souliote leader and hero of the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire. The Spanish general and liberal politician Rafael del Riego (1784–1823) was one of the leaders of the mutiny in the Spanish Civil War of 1820–3 that led to the reinstatement of the 1812 Constitution. General Józef Bem (1794–1850) was a Polish freedom-fighter who took part in uprisings in Poland, Austria and Hungary. The statesman Daniele Manin (1804–57) led the Venetian revolution against the Austrians in 1848–9, and was an early advocate of Italian unity. Antonio López de Santa Anna (1794–1876) fought for the independence of Mexico from Spanish rule, later becoming a presidential dictator. The American abolitionist and folk hero John Brown (1800–59), executed for murder and treason by the state of Virginia, is remembered in ‘John Brown’s Body’, which became a Union marching song during the American Civil War (1861–5). Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807–82) not only fought successfully for the liberation and unification of Italy, but also during exile in South America for the liberation of Uruguay from Argentina.</p>

</h5>
    
<p>The Boston Tea Party was an act of resistance to British rule that was to lead in 1775 to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. A military insurgency on Isla de León (now San Fernando) near Cadiz, in which Riego played so decisive a role, marked the beginning of the Spanish Civil War of 1820–3. The Pest Uprising of 1848 was the start of the ultimately doomed Hungarian Revolution. In one of the most dramatic achievements of the Italian Risorgimento, with a core force of only one thousand men Garibaldi captured Palermo from the Neapolitan Bourbon troops in 1860. He went on to take control of Naples and to hand over his territorial gains in southern Italy to the Piedmontese king Victor Emmanuel II. It was after the attack on the federal armoury and arsenal at Harpers Ferry in 1859, with the intention of arming abolitionists and triggering a slave uprising, that John Brown was tried and executed. Ancona fell to the patriots in September 1860. Gli Archi is a coastal district of Ancona that began to develop outside the walls of the city in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>A freedom-fighter during the Greek War of Independence, commanding fire boats that set fire to Turkish warships, Constantinos Canaris (1793/5–1877) rose to become an admiral in the Greek navy and was prime minister of Greece when he died. Colonel Antonio Quiroga (1784–1841) was one of the military leaders of the Spanish Revolution of 1820–23. An Italian socialist revolutionary, Carlo Pisacane (1818–57) was killed leading an abortive insurrection in Campania against the Kingdom of Naples.</p>

Buried in the Panthéon, his remains were removed when it became known he had colluded with the king in a failed attempt to establish a constitutional monarchy.</p>

</h5>
    
<p>In the 1830s two graffiti entered Parisian urban mythology (and French literature, in the texts of numerous writers who, like Hugo, recorded the phenomenon): a huge-nosed caricature identified as Bouginier, and the slogan ‘Crédeville voleur’, sometimes simply the name ‘Crédeville’. Their origins remain obscure, although a number of explanations have been offered. Crédeville, for instance, may have been the name of an escaped convict who left his calling-card, as it were, Pink Panther-like, to taunt the police; or the grieving fiancée of some Crédeville taken before his time may have been communicating in this way with her deceased lover; or some victim of a usurer called Crédeville may have been taking his revenge. Gérard de Nerval writes in <em>Voyage en Orient</em> that ‘Crédeville voleur’ and Bouginier’s nose are even to be found scrawled on the Pyramids. Privat d’Anglemont has an anecdotal account of Bouginier’s nose being used by the first of two separated parties of travellers to lay a trail between Paris and the Pyramids for those following behind them. (See Pierre Enckell, ‘Documents pour servir à l’histoire de Crédeville et de Bouginier’, in <em>Études nervaliennes et romantiques III</em>, Namur: Presses Universitaires de Namur, 1981.) Possibly one sighting was on the Theseion, now known as the temple of Hephaestus, in Athens, where many philhellenes killed in the Greek War of Independence (1821–30) were buried.</p>

<p>One of the great political philosophers of the Enlightenment, Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu (1689–1755), was elected to the French Academy in 1728 but remained something of an outsider, his first election to that institution in 1725 having been declared invalid because he was still resident in Bordeaux, where he was president of the criminal division of the local parliament. His two great works are his <em>Persian Letters</em> (1721), giving a view of European society through the eyes of two foreigners, and <em>The Spirit of the Laws</em> (1748), a study of different types of government and the legal and social institutions on which they rest.</p>

<p>The mathematician, philosopher and political theorist Nicolas de Condorcet (1743–94) was a central figure of the French Enlightenment, who believed in social progress through the power of education and knowledge. He was elected in 1791 to the Legislative Assembly, of which he was briefly president. However, opposed to the death penalty on principle, he voted against the execution of Louis XVI and subsequently defended the Girondists, which led to his own imprisonment. He was found dead in his cell, in circumstances which have never been entirely explained.</p>

</h5>
    
<p>From George Washington to Giuseppe Garibaldi, who as Hugo wrote was working to unify Italy, these men were heroes of nineteenth-century liberalism: Tadeusz Kościuszko (1746–1817) fought in the American Revolution before returning to his native Poland to lead an unsuccessful revolt against Russian rule; Kościuszko died in exile. Simon Bolívar was the great hero of South American independence from Spain. Markos Botzaris (1788–1823) was a leader of the Greek revolt against Ottoman rule. Rafael del Riego (1784–1823) was a leader of the liberal revolt against the king of Spain in 1822. Manin (1804–57) was a leader of the Risorgimento and early advocate of Italian nationalism. Carlos Antonio López (1796–1867) was the first president of Paraguay. Hugo considered the Abolitionist John Brown a hero and martyr. The persons and places named in these passages relate to the movements for independence and liberalism, often republicanism, in Europe (Greece, Italy, Spain, and Hungary) and across South America in the nineteenth century.</p>

In Palermo in 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi led an uprising against the reactionary Bourbon rulers of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.</p>
