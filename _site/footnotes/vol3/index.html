<p>Madden: Latin for child.</p>

<p>Donougher: Latin for ‘small’, meaning here ‘child’.</p>
<h4 id="the-gamin">
  
  
    the gamin: <a href="#the-gamin">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: Before his consecration by Hugo in the character of Gavroche, the Parisian gamin emerges as a social archetype, both celebrated and deplored by writers and illustrators, from 1830 and the July Revolution onwards. (See Jean-Jacques Yvorel, ‘De Delacroix à Poulbot, l’image du gamin de Paris’, <em>Revue d’histoire de l’enfance ‘irrégulière’</em>, no. 4 (2002), pp. 39–72, <a href="http://rhei.revues.org/index52.html">http://rhei.revues.org/index52.html</a></p>
<h5 id="homuncio">
  
  
    Homuncio: <a href="#homuncio">#</a>
  
  
</h5>
    
<p>Donougher: The term <em>homuncio</em>, ‘a little man’, was used by the later Roman comic playwright Terence (c.190–158 BC). Lewis and Short, <em>A Latin Dictionary</em>, 1879, also gives references to use of the word by Suetonius and Juvenal, but none by Plautus (c.254–184 BC).</p>

<p>Madden: little man. Plautus was a Roman playwright of the third century BCE whose comedies are a frequent point of reference in <em>Les Misérables</em> (see especially page 487 and see here).</p>

</h3>
    
<h4 id="dwarf">
  
  
    dwarf: <a href="#dwarf">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Madden: In royal and princely courts of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, dwarves were frequently employed as fools or jesters and, according to classical tradition, used their status to point out the foibles of the mighty, as with Shakespeare’s fool in <em>King Lear</em>. The dwarf-jester Triboulet is the protagonist of Hugo’s play <em>Le Roi s’amuse</em> (The King Takes His Pleasure), which inspired Verdi’s <em>Rigoletto</em>.</p>
<h4 id="cherub-of-the-gutter">
  
  
    cherub of the gutter: <a href="#cherub-of-the-gutter">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Madden: For French readers, especially in Hugo’s time, cherub, <em>chérubin</em>, had a double meaning: not only the Cupid-like angel but also the insolent, Puck-like character in Beaumarchais’ <em>Mariage de Figaro</em>.</p>
<h4 id="fiacres">
  
  
    fiacres: <a href="#fiacres">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Madden: one-horse hansom cabs that took their name from the place Saint-Fiacre, thought to be the place where the first carriages for hire were found.</p>
<h4 id="ponts-des-arts">
  
  
    <em>ponts des arts</em>: <a href="#ponts-des-arts">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: The Pont des Arts iron footbridge across the Seine was built in 1802–4, taking its name from the Palais des Arts, as the Louvre was then called, whereas the artistry in the gamin’s ‘bridges’ would be in their construction out of found objects.</p>
<h4 id="his-fabulous-monster">
  
  
    his fabulous monster: <a href="#his-fabulous-monster">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Madden: According to Yves Gohin, this monster is a memory of Hugo’s childhood, when he and his brother Eugène would frighten each other with tales of a monster who lived in the well of their house.</p>
<h4 id="talleyrand">
  
  
    Talleyrand: <a href="#talleyrand">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Madden: The celebrated diplomat (see here) was as well known for his sharp wit in society as for his unscrupulous survival skills in politics.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The prince de Talleyrand … Louis serving him as deacon: Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord (1754–1838) was one of the legendary figures of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras; a great aristocrat, a one time bishop, a revolutionary politician, and above all a political survivor, Talleyrand served virtually every government from the Constituent Assembly through the July Monarchy, reaching the peak of his influence as foreign minister of France, first to Napoléon and then, having helped orchestrate the emperor’s downfall, to Louis XVIII. The Congress of Vienna was a triumph for Talleyrand before Napoléon’s return from Elba cost him his standing with the allies. On July 14, 1790, as bishop of Autun and one of the leading members of the Constituent Assembly, Talleyrand had officiated at a mass of celebration dedicated to the Federation of French citizens and their volunteer militias performed on the Champ de Mars. He was assisted in that mass by a priest named Abbé Joseph Louis (1755–1837). Thanks largely to Talleyrand’s protection, the abbé Louis, more interested in economics than theology, had a long career in government, serving as minister of finance under the Restoration and later for Louis-Philippe.</p>

<p>Donougher: Like the gamin, another familiar term for a Parisian type.</p>
<h4 id="mademoiselle-mars--mademoiselle-muche">
  
  
    Mademoiselle Mars … Mademoiselle Muche: <a href="#mademoiselle-mars--mademoiselle-muche">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: The joke may be that Mademoiselle Mars was a brunette, and there is a fly (<em>mouche</em>) called a <em>brune de mars</em> (‘March brown fly’). A somewhat cryptic reference to <em>Muche</em> as a slang deformation of <em>Mars</em> appears in <em>Étude sur l’argot français</em> by Marcel Schwob and Georges Guieysse, Paris, 1889.</p>

<p>Madden: (see here)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jeanne-Marguerite Salvetat (1779–1847), known as Mademoiselle Mars, was the leading actress of the Comédie-Française from 1803 on. Mademoiselle Mars was Napoléon’s favourite actress and briefly his mistress. Later in her career, she would play Doña Sol in Hugo’s Hernani (1830). (see here).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hernani”: With tongue in cheek, Hugo mocks the reaction to his own play of 1830, which was enormously controversial for its complete break with the traditions of French theatre (hence, “not even written in French!”). The antithesis was one of Hugo’s favourite literary devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="de-profundis-to-carnival-numbers">
  
  
    <em>De Profundis</em> to carnival numbers: <a href="#de-profundis-to-carnival-numbers">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Madden: i.e., from religious hymns to bawdy ditties. Carnival, culminating in Mardi Gras, was celebrated with much more fervour in the nineteenth century, just as Lent was observed more scrupulously.</p>
<h4 id="rabelais">
  
  
    Rabelais: <a href="#rabelais">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Madden: see here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>François Rabelais (1494–1553) was one of the greatest writers of the French Renaissance. His comic novels Pantagruel and Gargantua combine broad humour, frequently scatological and sexual, with the humanistic ideals of the Renaissance.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="adamastor">
  
  
    Adamastor: <a href="#adamastor">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: The hideously fearsome giant that guards the southern Cape of Africa in the Portuguese epic poem <em>The Lusiads</em> (1572) by Luís de Camões (c.1524–80).</p>

<p>Madden: a monster imagined by the sixteenth-century Portuguese poet Luíz Vaz de Camões as a metaphor for the dangers of seafaring.</p>

<h4 id="prudhomme-and-fouillou">
  
  
    Prudhomme and Fouillou: <a href="#prudhomme-and-fouillou">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: Jacques Fouillou (1670–1736) was an independent-minded Jansenist theologian, born at La Rochelle, who made his career at the Sorbonne.</p>

<p>Madden: not specific people but personifications of two types: Prudhomme, from “prudent man” (see here), the cautious, complacent, and self-satisfied man so typical of the French bourgeoisie of the July Monarchy and the Second Empire, and Fouillou, from the verb <em>fouiller</em>, “to search” or “to dig,” the resourceful and self-reliant—sometimes slippery—type, like Figaro.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prudhomme and <em>prudhommerie</em> came to refer to banal mediocrity in nineteenth-century France, following the writer and illustrator Henri Monnier’s hugely successful caricature of the 1830s. Monnier’s Monsieur Prudhomme was well intentioned but also pretentious, vain, and ignorant. Hugo refers to <em>prudhommerie</em> frequently in <em>Les Misérables</em>.</p>

<h4 id="currit-rota">
  
  
    <em>Currit rota</em>: <a href="#currit-rota">#</a>

<p>Donougher: ‘The wheel turns.’ An allusion to Horace’s <em>Ars Poetica</em>, lines 21–2: ‘Amphora coepit / institui: currente rota cur urceus exit?’ (‘An amphora starts to be formed: why as the wheel turns is a kitchen jug the result?’).</p>

</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: An allusion to the opening lines of Horace’s Epistle 10, addressed to Aristius Fuscus: ‘Urbis amatorem Fuscum salvere iubemus / ruris amatores’ (‘We the country-lovers wish to salute Fuscus the town-lover’). Horace’s full name was Quintus Horatius Flaccus.</p>

<p>Madden: <em>urbis amator</em>, one who loves the city; <em>ruris amator</em>, one who loves the country. An allusion to the Epistles of Horace, specifically a letter the poet (Quintus Horatius Flaccus) wrote to a friend, Fuscus, in Rome.</p>
<h4 id="glacière-cunette--hideous-grenelle-wall--the-pierre-plate-de-châtillon">
  
  
    Glacière, Cunette … hideous Grenelle wall … the Pierre-Plate de Châtillon: <a href="#glacière-cunette--hideous-grenelle-wall--the-pierre-plate-de-châtillon">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: The wall at Grenelle was a place of execution for military and political offenders, where in 1812 General Lahorie, Hugo’s mother’s lover, met his end, condemned to death for his part in the Malet conspiracy against Napoleon, a failed <em>coup d’état</em> staged by General Charles-François de Malet (1754–1812) in October of that year, while Napoleon was in Russia.</p>

<p>Madden: As with the list of suburban villages at the end of the chapter, many of these sites can still be seen on a map of Paris and its outskirts. Of special note is the “hideous Grenelle wall riddled with bullet holes.” The <em>mur de Grenelle</em>—a since-demolished vestige of the medieval defensive wall—was the site of military executions by firing squad. Besides Hugo’s lifelong abhorrence of the death penalty, this was the site and method of execution of General Lahorie, Hugo’s godfather and his mother’s lover, convicted of plotting against Napoléon in 1812.</p>

    the swallows of the Pont d’Arcole: <a href="#the-swallows-of-the-pont-darcole">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: According to legend, the Pont d’Arcole was named not after Napoleon’s victory against the Austrians at the Bridge of Arcola in November 1796, but after a young Revolutionary of that name who died on this footbridge, previously called the Passerelle de Grève, during the 1830 Revolution. Over subsequent years the arches beneath the bridge became home to young Parisian vagabonds, referred to as <em>les hirondelles du Pont d’Arcole</em>.</p>

<p>Madden: a real group of homeless children who lived under the bridge and foraged through Paris like Fagin’s gang in the 1850s.</p>

<p>Donougher: The chronicler Edmond Barbier (1689–1771) in his <em>Journal historique et anecdotique du règne de Louis XV</em> (1847–56, vol. 3) writes of the abduction of children (pp. 124–60) and of bloodbaths (p. 125).</p>

    Claude Gueux: <a href="#claude-gueux">#</a>

<p>Donougher: In fact the word <em>gamin</em> appears in print in earlier texts than Hugo’s short story of 1834, not least in Hugo’s <em>Notre-Dame de Paris</em> (1831, bk II, ch. 5).</p>

<p>Madden: <em>Claude Gueux</em> was in fact an 1834 novel by Hugo himself. He had already used the word <em>gamin</em> in <em>Notre-Dame de Paris;</em> it is quite possible he forgot in the thirty-year interval between that novel and <em>Les Misérables</em>.</p>

<p>Donougher: The Sanson family held the office of public executioner from 1688 until 1847. Abbé Montès was chaplain of the Conciergerie prison, attending those condemned to death, including Pierre-François Lacenaire, who was executed for murder and theft in January 1836, together with his accomplice Victor Avril. While in prison Lacenaire wrote songs, poems and his memoirs (published after his death). He was reincarnated as the criminal poet dandy in Marcel Carné’s film <em>Les Enfants du Paradis</em>. For details of Lacenaire’s role model, the notorious murderer Dautun, see note p. 1315. Louis-Auguste Papavoine was executed in March 1825 for the murder of two children. Edmé-Henri-Charles Tolleron, an engraver, was found guilty of taking part in a seditious plot – orchestrated by agents provocateurs – against the Bourbon monarchy, and was executed in July 1816. François Delaporte was executed, together with two accomplices, in April 1824 for highway robbery. In <em>Victor Hugo raconté par un témoin de sa vie</em>, Hugo is said to have seen both Louvel (the Duc de Berry’s assassin) and the bald Delaporte (‘an old man’) on their way to execution (Louvel, in June 1820). Dr Edme-Samuel Castaing was executed in December 1823 for the murder of two brothers (of the first with the complicity of the second, who paid him handsomely for it). Jean-François-Louis-Clair Bories was one of the four young sergeants of La Rochelle (along with Pommier, Raoulx and Goubin) executed for sedition in September 1822, despite Bories’s attempt to exculpate his companions. Jean Martin is the name of a parricide referred to in <em>Victor Hugo raconté par un témoin de sa vie</em> as having been executed in 1825. In Hugo’s 1829 novel <em>Le Dernier jour d’un condamné</em>, written in protest against capital punishment, Jean Martin’s name appears on the wall of the narrator’s prison with the date 1821. However, the only parricide with a name bearing any resemblance to Jean Martin who died during this period of whom there is any record was thirty-three-year-old Pierre-Martin Godefroy, executed along with his brother in 1820 for the murder of their father in 1815. Lecouffé and his mother were executed in January 1824 for the murder of an old woman carried out by Lecouffé at his mother’s instigation. Philippe-François Debacker was executed in June 1829 for the murder of his mistress and her employer.</p>

<p>Madden: The Sanson family were the chief executioners in Paris from 1688 to 1847, the office passing from father to son. The abbé Montès was the chief almoner for the prisons of Paris under the Restoration and the July Monarchy.</p>

<p>Like the rest of the criminals named in this chapter, Lacenaire was a real person. Pierre François Lacenaire (1803–36) was the well-educated son of a prosperous merchant in Lyon; arrested for two murders—and a third that he had attempted—Lacenaire managed to make himself a celebrity in prison, writing poetry and his memoirs before his execution was carried out. Hugo would have been thirteen when he saw Dautun executed for the  murder of his brother in 1816 (see here).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Charles Dautun murdered his brother in 1814 and was beheaded for it in 1816.
Papavoine was executed for murdering two children in the Bois de Vincennes. Tolleron was one of those executed in an 1816 plot to blow up the Tuileries Palace. Avril was Lacenaire’s friend and accomplice. Louvel assassinated the duc de Berry in 1820 (see here).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The duc de Berry was the younger son of the comte d’Artois. As the duchesse d’Angoulême, the wife of his elder brother and daughter of Louis XVI, was past childbearing age, the younger prince’s marriage was a matter of state concern. He was married to his distant cousin Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Sicile, daughter of the king of Naples and Sicily. The duc de Berry was assassinated at the Opéra by Louvel in 1820; the fact that his young wife was pregnant was taken by royalists as a sign of divine favour for the Bourbon monarchy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Delaporte was a highwayman executed in 1824; Castaing (1793–1824) murdered two of his friends in order to inherit their fortunes. Bories was one of four soldiers condemned to death for plotting a republican coup in the plot of the “Sergents de Rochelle.” Jean-Martin is a mistaken reference to Paul-Louis Martin, who was beheaded for murdering his father in 1820. Madame Lecouffé pushed her son to murder an old lady so that they could rob her. Castaing, Bories, Martin, Dautun, and Papavoine were mentioned in Hugo’s <em>Last Day of a Condemned Man</em>. The details of the criminal named Debacker are elusive.</p>

<p>Madden: Beginning his career with public harangues in the garden of the Palais-Royal, Desmoulins (1760–94) became one of the most ardent revolutionaries, serving as Danton’s secretary in the first republican government in 1792. Desmoulins was appalled by the excesses of the Terror and became a critic of Robespierre, which proved fatal. He was guillotined along with Danton in April 1794.</p>

<p>Donougher: As commander-in-chief of the French ‘army of Rome’, sent to protect the infant Roman Republic in 1798, General Jean-Étienne Championnet (1762–1800) succeeded not only in defending Rome against the Neapolitan king but also in capturing Naples. To celebrate the achievement he was determined that the miracle of the liquefaction of the blood of Naples’s patron saint Januarius should occur. And it did. St Genevieve is the patron saint of Paris. The church of St-Étienne du Mont houses the relics of St Genevieve and the Rue St-Jean de Beauvais is near by. Championnet was born and brought up in the south-east of France.</p>

<p>Madden:
Jean-Étienne Championnet (1762–1800) rose from simple soldier to general in less than ten years. As commander of the army that took Naples in 1798, Championnet persuaded the archbishop to celebrate the miracle of Saint Januarius (San Gennaro), in which the prelate holds up a vial of the saint’s dried blood and declares that it has turned back to liquid.</p>

There were even plans for the boy to be buried in the Panthéon, and his death was celebrated in a painting by David, now at the Musée Calvet in Avignon.</p>

<p>Madden: Joseph Barra or Bara (1780–93), a legendary martyr of the Republic, was killed by Chouan troops in 1793 after he refused to say “Vive le roi” and instead cried out “Vive la République!” Robespierre quickly adopted the boy’s death as a symbol of republican devotion and royalist brutality.</p>

</h5>
    
<p>Donougher: One of the seven hills on which ancient Rome was built, the Aventine Hill lay outside the city’s original boundary and, like the Faubourg St-Antoine, was incorporated within its walls at a later date. Amid his celebrations of Paris as a rival to Rome, Hugo aims a gibe at the Sorbonne – an asinarium is a collection of asses. Dating from around 50 BC and designed to serve as a weathervane, sundial and water clock, the Tower of the Winds, also called the Horologion of Andronicus, stands close to the Roman agora in Athens. On the Gemonian Steps, which led past the prison in ancient Rome, the bodies of executed criminals were left exposed before being thrown into the river (see Tacitus, <em>Annals</em> 3:14 or <em>Histories</em> 3:74).</p>

<p>Madden: Hugo believed that Paris was the heir to Rome, as Rome had been heir to Athens, the centre of the civilized world. His comparison begins at the top of the political and social order, by directly comparing the symbols of the government (the Capitol and the Hôtel de Ville), of religion (the Parthenon and Notre-Dame), etc. The Sorbonne is apparently set apart for satire, as an Asinarium, or donkey shed, the “house of asses.” Hugo descends from the highest to the lowest aspects of Parisian society and compares the city to the Rome he knew from his readings of classical texts, especially Plautus, whose comedies provide many of the characters in Hugo’s long comparison. Only those citations that have some broader echo in <em>Les Misérables</em> or Hugo’s life and work are explained here.</p>

    The Parisian majo … un gandin: <a href="#the-parisian-majo--un-gandin">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: Flourishing in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the Spanish <em>majo</em> (female <em>maja</em>) was a working-class dandy who favoured an exaggeratedly Spanish traditional costume. The French <em>faraud</em> is a more fatuous kind of dandy. Matched in Paris by the <em>faubourien</em> inhabitant of the working-class <em>faubourgs</em>, the <em>trasteverino</em> inhabitant of Trastevere, on the far side of the Tiber, had the reputation of embodying the soul of the true Roman. The Turkish <em>hamal</em>, bent double under his load, has his equivalent in the beefy market porter of Paris. The Neapolitan scoundrel, the <em>lazzarone</em> and the Parisian <em>pègre</em> are both members of a similarly low-class fraternity of petty criminals. What is common to the cockney, as understood by the French, and the <em>gandin</em> is a kind of Jack-the-lad, cock-of-the-walk, preening self-confidence.</p>

</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: A repeated taunt in the comedies of the Greek playwright Aristophanes is that the mother of the tragedian Euripides was a herb-seller. For the French grammarian, philosopher and contributor to Diderot and d’Alembert’s <em>Encyclopédie</em>, César Chesneau, Sieur Dumarsais (1676–1756), life was always a struggle. His father died when he was young and his mother squandered his inheritance, including the library, which had to be sold. Hugo refers to her here as the <em>poissarde</em>, a word that came to mean ‘fishwife’ but has the older meaning of ‘thief’ (apparently deriving from the word <em>poisse</em>, slime left on the hands and clothes of people who handle fish – see R. Anthony Lodge, <em>A Sociolinguistic History of Parisian French</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 163).</p>

In the mid nineteenth century the acrobat Thévelin performed on a trapeze suspended from a balloon at the Hippodrome, and the trapeze act continued to evolve as part of the circus repertoire. The reference to Plautus’ trapeze is possibly a play on the Latin word <em>trapezita</em>, ‘banker’, of which there are many in Plautus’ plays, including <em>Curculio</em> (The Forgery).</p>

<p>Donougher: Located beyond the city walls and therefore exempt from the Parisian tax on wine, La Courtille on the heights of Belleville was where Parisians went to enjoy themselves in its many bars, dance halls and restaurants. Mardi Gras festivities continued there throughout the night and the procession of revellers returning to Paris, known as the <em>descente de la Courtille</em>, marked the end of Carnival.</p>

<p>Donougher: The Roman author of <em>Noctes Atticae</em> (Attic Nights), written in the mid second century AD and consisting of notes on a wide range of subjects, Aulus Gellius cites the works of many Greek and Latin writers (he mentions 275 by name), for some of whom little else or nothing has survived. Congrio is the cook in Plautus’ <em>Aulularia</em> (The Pot of Gold), and Aulus Gellius was a great admirer of Plautus. The writer Charles Nodier (1780–1844), a patron and friend of Hugo, was enamoured of Pulchinello and wrote an enthusiastic article celebrating the character (‘Polichinelle’, <em>Paris, ou le Livre des Cent-et-un</em>, vol. 2, Ladvocat: Paris, 1831).</p>

</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: The hugely successful songwriter Marc-Antoine Désaugier (1772–1827) summed up a whole philosophy of life in the refrain of one of his most popular compositions: ‘Verse encor / encor, encor, encor, / encor un rouge bord, / Dieu joufflu de la treille! / Verse encor, / encor, encor, encor. / Par toi tout se réveille, / Et sans toi tout est mort’ (‘Pour another, / and another, and another, / another brimming glass of red, / Chubby-cheeked god of the vine, / Through you everything wakens, / And without you everything is dead’). At Nasidienus’ feast (Horace, <em>Satires</em> II:8), guests Balatro and his dining companion Vibidius call for larger glasses (lines 34–6) and serve themselves generously (lines 40–1).</p>

<p>Donougher: Paris’s Père-Lachaise cemetery was opened in 1804 in what was then an outlying district of the city, and only after the remains of La Fontaine, Molière, Abelard and Héloïse were transferred there in 1817 did it become a fashionable burial ground. The eastern slopes of the Esquiline, one of the seven hills of Rome, was at one time a burial place for paupers (see Horace <em>Satires</em> I:8, line 10).</p>

    Trophonius’ cave … Mesmer’s tub: <a href="#trophonius-cave--mesmers-tub">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: Consulting the ancient Greek oracle of Trophonius was a complicated and unnerving experience (as described by Pausanias in his <em>Description of Greece</em>, Boeotia, ch. 39), which involved descending into a dark cave. Unable to deal individually with the numbers who flocked to him, the legendary healer Anton Mesmer (1734–1815) developed the <em>baquet</em>, a kind of tub around which the patients sat to receive his therapy, based on his theory of animal magnetism. (The commission set up in 1784 to investigate this therapy was headed by Benjamin Franklin, then American ambassador to Paris.)</p>

    <em>Ergaphilas … Cagliostro</em>: <a href="#ergaphilas--cagliostro">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: Count Alessandro di Cagliostro (1743–95) was a man whose life was shrouded in mystery and occultism, who has been identified as an Italian adventurer named Giuseppe Balsamo, although Cagliostro himself denied this. He was eventually arrested by spies of the Inquisition and sentenced to death for being a freemason, although this sentence was apparently commuted to life imprisonment. He has enjoyed a long and varied afterlife in numerous literary and musical manifestations. Ergaphilas may be the Athenian general Ergophilus, who shared with Cagliostro the experience of escaping the death sentence (Aristotle, <em>Rhetoric</em>, 2.3.13: ‘For men grow mild when they have exhausted their anger upon another, as happened in the case of Ergophilus. For although the Athenians were more indignant with him than with Callisthenes, they acquitted him because they had condemned Callisthenes the day before.’)</p>

<p>Donougher: The tomb of the saintly Jansenist deacon François de Pâris, buried in St-Médard Cemetery in 1727, became a shrine of devotion and the site of miraculous cures among those who flocked to it, many of whom were seized with strange convulsions, a phenomenon that was first recorded in 1731 and persisted for some fifteen years. The great holy shrine in Damascus is the Ummayad Mosque.</p>
<h4 id="mayeux">
  
  
    Mayeux: <a href="#mayeux">#</a>

<p>Donougher: Canidia is a sorceress who appears in three of Horace’s texts (<em>Epodes</em> 5, 17; <em>Satires</em> I:8). Mademoiselle Lenormand (1772–1843) was a renowned fortune-teller, supposedly consulted by Napoleon and the empress Josephine.</p>

<h4 id="chodruc-duclos">
  
  
    Chodruc-Duclos: <a href="#chodruc-duclos">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: A diehard royalist, Chodruc-Duclos (1780–1842), once an exceptionally handsome young man, outraged not to be given the high military office he thought he deserved when the monarchy was restored, became a familiar figure on the streets of Paris; like the Greek philosopher Diogenes, he lived the life of a tramp for years until his death. He was on several occasions arrested and even imprisoned, but charges against him were hard to uphold: he could not be called a vagrant since he owned property in his native Gascony, and he argued that the small amounts of money he solicited were loans rather than the fruits of begging.</p>

    Sulla and Domitian: <a href="#sulla-and-domitian">#</a>

<p>Donougher: Having defeated his political opponents on the battlefield, Sulla was appointed dictator of Rome in 82 BC; he instituted a reign of terror, after two years abdicated, re-established consular government, then retired. He died in 78 BC. Domitian (51–96) ruled as emperor for fifteen years and is portrayed by Suetonius as a cruel and avaricious tyrant. After he was assassinated in a conspiracy involving those close to him, the Senate condemned his memory to oblivion.</p>

</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: ‘Against the Gracchi we have the Tiber. To drink the Tiber is to forget sedition.’ The Gracchi – Tiberius (163–133 BC) and his younger brother Gaius (154–121 BC) – were Roman tribunes who, in the context of increasing social unrest among the lower classes of society, attempted to introduce land reform in favour of the poor and met with overwhelming resistance from the Senate. Both Gracchi met with a violent end.</p>

<p>Donougher: The <em>Callipygian Venus</em> is a Roman marble statue dating from the first century BC, which was rediscovered in Rome in the sixteenth century and is now held in the National Archaeological Museum of Naples. The epithet ‘callipygian’ is from the Greek, meaning ‘with beautiful buttocks’. Sara Baartman, who came to England from South Africa in 1810 (and subsequently travelled to Paris where she later died), became known as ‘the Hottentot Venus’, her physique – her large buttocks in particular, characteristic of her Khoekhoe origins – attracting immense curiosity and scientific interest. Her remains were finally returned to South Africa in 2002.</p>

Polymnia was the muse of sacred poetry, and the Janiculum Hill on the west bank of the Tiber, outside the walls of Rome, was a place of sacred woods and shrines.</p>

<p>Madden: the celebrated moment of June 20, 1789, when the deputies of the Third Estate declared themselves the representatives of the French nation and vowed that they would not disband until they had established a constitution for France.

</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: Before he was elected first President of the United States, George Washington (1732–99) was appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War (1775–83). Tadeusz Kosciuszko (1746–1817) was leader of the 1794 uprising against Imperial Russia and the Kingdom of Prussia, having previously served as colonel in the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War. Markos Botsaris (1788–1823) was a Souliote leader and hero of the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire. The Spanish general and liberal politician Rafael del Riego (1784–1823) was one of the leaders of the mutiny in the Spanish Civil War of 1820–3 that led to the reinstatement of the 1812 Constitution. General Józef Bem (1794–1850) was a Polish freedom-fighter who took part in uprisings in Poland, Austria and Hungary. The statesman Daniele Manin (1804–57) led the Venetian revolution against the Austrians in 1848–9, and was an early advocate of Italian unity. Antonio López de Santa Anna (1794–1876) fought for the independence of Mexico from Spanish rule, later becoming a presidential dictator. The American abolitionist and folk hero John Brown (1800–59), executed for murder and treason by the state of Virginia, is remembered in ‘John Brown’s Body’, which became a Union marching song during the American Civil War (1861–5). Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807–82) not only fought successfully for the liberation and unification of Italy, but also during exile in South America for the liberation of Uruguay from Argentina.</p>

<p>Madden: From George Washington to Giuseppe Garibaldi, who as Hugo wrote was working to unify Italy, these men were heroes of nineteenth-century liberalism: Tadeusz Kościuszko (1746–1817) fought in the American Revolution before returning to his native Poland to lead an unsuccessful revolt against Russian rule; Kościuszko died in exile. Simon Bolívar was the great hero of South American independence from Spain. Markos Botzaris (1788–1823) was a leader of the Greek revolt against Ottoman rule. Rafael del Riego (1784–1823) was a leader of the liberal revolt against the king of Spain in 1822. Manin (1804–57) was a leader of the Risorgimento and early advocate of Italian nationalism. Carlos Antonio López (1796–1867) was the first president of Paraguay. Hugo considered the Abolitionist John Brown a hero and martyr. The persons and places named in these passages relate to the movements for independence and liberalism, often republicanism, in Europe (Greece, Italy, Spain, and Hungary) and across South America in the nineteenth century.</p>

</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: The Boston Tea Party was an act of resistance to British rule that was to lead in 1775 to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. A military insurgency on Isla de León (now San Fernando) near Cadiz, in which Riego played so decisive a role, marked the beginning of the Spanish Civil War of 1820–3. The Pest Uprising of 1848 was the start of the ultimately doomed Hungarian Revolution. In one of the most dramatic achievements of the Italian Risorgimento, with a core force of only one thousand men Garibaldi captured Palermo from the Neapolitan Bourbon troops in 1860. He went on to take control of Naples and to hand over his territorial gains in southern Italy to the Piedmontese king Victor Emmanuel II. It was after the attack on the federal armoury and arsenal at Harpers Ferry in 1859, with the intention of arming abolitionists and triggering a slave uprising, that John Brown was tried and executed. Ancona fell to the patriots in September 1860. Gli Archi is a coastal district of Ancona that began to develop outside the walls of the city in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Madden: Just as Boston is the cradle of American liberty, the other cities and sites named represent republican and independence movements across Europe in the nineteenth century. “Pest in 1848” refers to the Hungarian uprising against the Hapsburgs. The island of St. Léon was a stronghold for the liberal Spanish insurgents in 1820. In Palermo in 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi led an uprising against the reactionary Bourbon rulers of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.</p>

<p>Donougher: A freedom-fighter during the Greek War of Independence, commanding fire boats that set fire to Turkish warships, Constantinos Canaris (1793/5–1877) rose to become an admiral in the Greek navy and was prime minister of Greece when he died. Colonel Antonio Quiroga (1784–1841) was one of the military leaders of the Spanish Revolution of 1820–23. An Italian socialist revolutionary, Carlo Pisacane (1818–57) was killed leading an abortive insurrection in Campania against the Kingdom of Naples.</p>

<p>Donougher: Author of <em>Observations on Yellow Fever, Made at Cadiz in</em> 1819, Dr André Mazet (1793–1821) himself died of yellow fever when, as a member of a French medical team, he returned to Spain to provide assistance during a later outbreak of the disease in Barcelona.</p>

<p>Madden: Dr. Mazet was one of a group of French physicians who travelled to Barcelona in 1821 in order to study and help fight an epidemic of yellow fever; Mazet died after contracting the disease himself. Hugo’s 1822 poem “Le Dévouement” was inspired by Mazet and the other members of the humanitarian expedition.</p>

</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: Rejected by his fellow aristocrats as a potential delegate to the Estates General in 1788, Mirabeau (1749–91) with his great oratorial and pamphleteering skills was elected as a commoner to the Third Estate and elected president of the National Assembly three months before he died. Buried in the Panthéon, his remains were removed when it became known he had colluded with the king in a failed attempt to establish a constitutional monarchy.</p>

<p>Madden: After a decidedly ambiguous early life, Honoré-Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, became one of the heroes of the Revolution due to his powerful speeches to the National Assembly. Robespierre was doomed when he became tyrant in the name of republicanism.</p>

</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: In the 1830s two graffiti entered Parisian urban mythology (and French literature, in the texts of numerous writers who, like Hugo, recorded the phenomenon): a huge-nosed caricature identified as Bouginier, and the slogan ‘Crédeville voleur’, sometimes simply the name ‘Crédeville’. Their origins remain obscure, although a number of explanations have been offered. Crédeville, for instance, may have been the name of an escaped convict who left his calling-card, as it were, Pink Panther-like, to taunt the police; or the grieving fiancée of some Crédeville taken before his time may have been communicating in this way with her deceased lover; or some victim of a usurer called Crédeville may have been taking his revenge. Gérard de Nerval writes in <em>Voyage en Orient</em> that ‘Crédeville voleur’ and Bouginier’s nose are even to be found scrawled on the Pyramids. Privat d’Anglemont has an anecdotal account of Bouginier’s nose being used by the first of two separated parties of travellers to lay a trail between Paris and the Pyramids for those following behind them. (See Pierre Enckell, ‘Documents pour servir à l’histoire de Crédeville et de Bouginier’, in <em>Études nervaliennes et romantiques III</em>, Namur: Presses Universitaires de Namur, 1981.) Possibly one sighting was on the Theseion, now known as the temple of Hephaestus, in Athens, where many philhellenes killed in the Greek War of Independence (1821–30) were buried.</p>

<p>Madden: two popular instances of Parisian graffiti that took on lives of their own as the French travelled through Europe. Legend has it that “<em>Crédéville voleur</em>” is in fact written at the top of an Egyptian pyramid.</p>

<p>Madden: A chronological list of the writers who over the course of the eighteenth century made it possible for Danton to act on his daring. Montesquieu’s (1689–1755) <em>L’Esprit des lois</em> (On the Spirit of Laws) is one of the founding documents of the Enlightenment and of modern political science. The mathematician marquis de Condorcet (1749–94), called the last of the <em>philosophes</em>, joined the (relatively) moderate Girondin faction in the Convention. Arouet is Voltaire’s real name.</p>
<h4 id="montesquieu">

</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: One of the great political philosophers of the Enlightenment, Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu (1689–1755), was elected to the French Academy in 1728 but remained something of an outsider, his first election to that institution in 1725 having been declared invalid because he was still resident in Bordeaux, where he was president of the criminal division of the local parliament. His two great works are his <em>Persian Letters</em> (1721), giving a view of European society through the eyes of two foreigners, and <em>The Spirit of the Laws</em> (1748), a study of different types of government and the legal and social institutions on which they rest.</p>
<h4 id="condorcet">

</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: The mathematician, philosopher and political theorist Nicolas de Condorcet (1743–94) was a central figure of the French Enlightenment, who believed in social progress through the power of education and knowledge. He was elected in 1791 to the Legislative Assembly, of which he was briefly president. However, opposed to the death penalty on principle, he voted against the execution of Louis XVI and subsequently defended the Girondists, which led to his own imprisonment. He was found dead in his cell, in circumstances which have never been entirely explained.</p>

Prisoners serving on the galleys were allowed to use skills they might have – and a significant number were textile artisans – to earn money working in port during the winter months when the galleys were not sailing.</p>

<p>Madden: The duc de Vivonne, later duc de Rochechouart, was a great favourite of Louis XIV, who made him Général des Galères, essentially head of the French navy, because of both his military service and the fact that he was the brother of the royal mistress, Madame de Montespan.</p>

<p>Madden: Marie-Anne Camargo (1710–70) and Marie Sallé (1707–56) were dancers at the Opéra. Voltaire wrote an ode to them that began: “<em>Ah! Camargo, que vous êtes brillante! / Mais que Sallé, grands Dieux, est ravissante!</em>”</p>

<p>Madden: Jacques-Joseph de Corbière was the son of a carpenter who became minister of the interior from 1821 to 1824; Georges Humann was, like Casimir Périer (see here), a banker and politician; Humann served as minister of finance several times under the July Monarchy, the first time in 1832.

<p>Donougher: The elixir, thought to be a tincture of gold and not only to have remedial powers – as a cure for syphilis – but also to prolong life, was a solution of ferric chloride in alcohol. The Russian count Alexis Bestuchef-Rumin was the first to discover this concoction in 1725, but its secret then fell into the hands of General Lamotte, who produced a version of it in Paris, for which he was awarded a pension by Louis XV. Around 1780 the then holders of the secrets of the preparation presented the recipe to Catherine the Great, who paid them 3,000 roubles and ordered the publication of the tincture’s composition.</p>

<p>Madden: In 1797, the Directory government, faced with a huge public debt, declared that all outstanding government securities would be paid out only at one third of their value. Like the rue Quincampoix, the traditional location of bankers in ancien régime France, such vulgar matters of finance are beneath Monsieur Gillenormand’s attention.</p>

<p>Donougher: The Scottish economist John Law (1671–1729), appointed controller-general of finances by Louis XV, in 1716 established in Rue Quincampoix the Banque Générale, which developed the use of paper money. Law’s career ended, and fortunes were lost, with the collapse of the bank during the Mississippi Bubble of 1720.</p>

<p>Donougher: Louis de Bonald (1754–1840), appointed minister in 1822 and made a peer in 1823, was a critic of the Enlightenment and an advocate of aristocratic institutions.</p>

<p>A friend of de Bonald, Philippe Bengy-Puy-Vallée (1743–1823), of noble descent, served in the pre-Revolutionary army, fled France as an émigré, then returned under the Consulate.</p>

<p>Madden: two paragons of ultra-royalism under the Restoration. The vicomte de Bonald (1754–1840) was an influential writer and legislator; Monsieur Bengy-Puy-Vallée was rather more obscure, and there may be some irony in the pairing of these two names.</p>

They went on to storm the Tuileries on 10 August.</p>

</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: ‘Sabrant’ (‘sabring’) being a homophone of ‘Sabran’: ‘Damas <em>sabring</em> Gouvion St-Cyr’.</p>

<p>Donougher: After a military career Ange Hyacinthe Maxence de Damas de Cormaillon, Baron de Damas (1785–1862) served briefly under the Restoration as minister of war and minister of foreign affairs; Comte Elzéar-Louis-Zozime de Sabran (1764–1847) served in the émigré army and in 1814 was made a general by Louis XVIII; Laurent de Gouvion St-Cyr (1764–1830) distinguished himself in the Napoleonic Wars but his opposition to Napoleon becoming emperor delayed his promotion to marshal. He served as minister of war under the Restoration and was made marquis in 1817.</p>

<p>Madden: The marquis de Gouvion-Saint-Cyr (1764–1830) and the baron de Damas (1785–1862) were both aristocrats who served in the imperial armies and then the Restoration government, Damas succeeding Saint-Cyr as minister of war under Louis XVIII.

<p>Donougher translation:<br />
Ah! it’ll come! it’ll come! it’ll come!<br />
Bonapartists from lamp-posts strung!<br /></p>

<p>Donougher: <em>Ça ira</em> is an idiomatic expression meaning ‘Things will work out’ or ‘We’ll get there.’ It was supposedly Benjamin Franklin’s answer when asked in Paris how the American War of Independence was going. The refrain of this Revolutionary song – ‘Ah! ça ira! ça ira! ça ira! / Les aristocrates à la lanterne!’ (the salon members substitute the word ‘Bonapartists’ for ‘aristocrats’) – was so popular that it was sung as the refrain of another Revolutionary song, the ‘Carmagnole’. Both songs were banned in 1799 when Napoleon became first consul.</p>

<p>Madden: a popular and violent revolutionary song that celebrated the hanging of aristocrats from the lampposts of Paris. The denizens of Madame de T——’s salon have replaced the aristocrats with “Buonapartists” in their lyrics.</p>

    Fualdès affair: <a href="#fualdès-affair">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: The brutal murder, in March 1817, of the retired prosecutor Antoine-Bernardin Fualdès (born 1761) and the subsequent trials – the first was declared a mistrial on a legal technicality – created a sensation and were covered widely in the press, both in France and abroad. Indicative of the huge interest is Mary Shelley’s request, in a letter from Italy dated 30 April 1818 addressed to Thomas Love Peacock, for a publication about the trial to be sent out to her (<em>The Letters of Thomas Love Peacock: 1792</em>–<em>1827</em>, ed. Nicholas A. Joukovsky, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 132). Charles Bastide-Gramont (godson of Fualdès), Joseph Jausion and Jean-Baptiste Collard were executed for the murder. The whole affair remains contentious.</p>

<p>Madden: In 1817, Antoine-Bernadin Fualdès, a former public prosecutor (<em>procureur impérial</em>) under the Napoleonic government, was brutally murdered in Rodez. Two men named Bastide and Jausion were arrested, convicted, and executed in Toulouse in 1818. The sensational case was closely followed throughout France.</p>

<p>Donougher: The involvement of the Comte de Lamothe-Valois (or more usually La Motte; 1755–1831) in the necklace affair, a fraud perpetrated by his wife, who arranged the forging of Marie-Antoinette’s signature in order to acquire a diamond necklace for herself – and which was exploited by anti-royalists to discredit the queen – should have made him anathema to this royalist salon.</p>

<p>Madden: Antoine-Nicolas Lamothe, or Lamotte, a fraudulent count who married Jeanne de Valois-Saint-Rémy (1756–91), the descendant of a bastard of the Valois dynasty. The comte de Lamothe-Valois and his wife had been the principal orchestrators of the “Necklace Affair,” an ancien régime scandal that had badly damaged the public image of the royal family, hence the “strange amnesties.”</p>

<p>Donougher: Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson, Madame de Pompadour (1721–64), was Louis XV’s mistress from 1745 until her death. Her brother Abel became Marquis de Marigny in 1754. The Prince de Soubise, Charles de Rohan (1715–87), was a protégé of Madame de Pompadour, and through her influence was given command of an army during the Seven Years War (1756–63); he suffered a humiliating defeat at the battle of Rossbach in 1757.</p>

<p>Madden: Louis XV had made his mistress’s brother, Abel Poisson, the marquis de Marigny.</p>

<p>Madden: The prince de Soubise was a member of the Rohan family, who claimed descent from the ancient kings of Brittany. He was the father-in-law (and cousin) of the prince de Guéménée, whose bankruptcy in 1782 was still another scandal for the court aristocracy.</p>

In 1768 du Barry arranged for her to be married to his brother Comte Guillaume du Barry (1732–1811) so that she could become the official mistress of Louis XV.</p>

<p>Madden: “Godfather” could not be used more ironically. Jean du Barry was the patron and brother-in-law of Madame du Barry, née Jeanne Bécu, Vaubernier being the name of her father, a monk at the Picpus monastery in Paris. Du Barry married the beautiful young [sex worker] to his elder brother, the comte du Barry, in order to give her entry into high society and thus a better clientele. She eventually became the mistress of Louis XV.</p>

<p>Madden: Monsieur le maréchal de Richelieu was one of the celebrated <em>grands seigneurs</em> and libertines of the eighteenth century. The ducs de Richelieu were the (indirect) descendants and heirs of the cardinal de Richelieu.</p>

The Greek god Hermes (Mercury in the Roman pantheon) is characterized in classical literature as a thief, associated in particular with the theft of Apollo’s oxen (‘of many shifts, blandly cunning, a robber, a cattle driver, a bringer of dreams, a watcher by night, a thief at the gates’ – <em>Homeric Hymn IV, To Hermes</em>, lines 13–15).

In 1814, General Hugo was sent to command the fortified town of Thionville, where he held out against the allies even after Napoléon had surrendered and embarked for Elba. During the Hundred Days, Napoléon sent him back to Thionville, which he again held after the final abdication.

</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: General Jean-Nicolas Houchard (1738–1793), a soldier of humble origins, rose through the ranks to a position of command that exceeded his capabilities. Appointed commander-in-chief of the Army of the North in 1793, during the French Revolutionary Wars, he was arrested on charges of cowardice for his failure to pursue the enemy after winning the battle of Hondschoote in September 1793. Despite the many scars of battle that he bore, he was found guilty by the Revolutionary Tribunal and sent to the guillotine.</p>

<p>Madden: General Jean-Nicolas Houchard (1740–1793) was guillotined in November 1793, after attempting a strategic retreat to Audernach that turned into a rout of French armies by the forces of the prince of Hesse.</p>

<p>Donougher: General Barthélemy-Catherine Joubert (1769–99): ‘In 1791 [Joubert] enrolled as a volunteer, and served in all the lower ranks, from that of an ordinary grenadier. Having been made an infantry lieutenant, he was charged in September 1793 with the defence of a redoubt on the Col di Tenda: surrounded by five hundred Piedmontese, it was only after a spirited resistance that he was taken prisoner’ (Louis-Gabriel Michaud, <em>Biographie Universelle</em>, 1843). Joubert was killed at the battle of Novi (15 August 1799).</p>

<p>Madden: Barthélemy Catherine Joubert (1769–99), Napoléon’s successor commanding the Army of Italy, was defeated by the Austrians and their Russian allies before being killed at the battle of Novi in August 1799.</p>

<p>Donougher: Louis-Alexandre Berthier (1753–1815) was Napoleon’s chief of staff, serving him in that post from 1794. The words are from a letter of 11 May 1796 written by Napoleon to the Directory, the day after the battle of Lodi, when the bridge held by the Austrians was taken by the French.</p>

<p>Madden: Prince Louis-Alexandre Berthier (1753–1815) was Napoléon’s chief of staff and closest confidant. Lodi was a significant victory (May 1796) in establishing General Bonaparte’s reputation as the heroic commander of the Army of Italy.</p>

</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: Hugo’s paternal uncle Louis (1777–1853) was awarded the Legion of Honour for his part in the battle of Eylau, fought against the Russians in East Prussia in February 1807. His defence of the cemetery is told in Victor Hugo’s poem ‘Le Cimetière d’Eylau’, published in the second series of his epic cycle <em>La Légende des Siècles</em>, on which he began work in 1862 and which was published in 1877.</p>

<p>Madden: a hard-won victory over the Russians and Prussians (February 1807); it was Eylau and even more so the victory at Friedland the following June that led Czar Alexander to accept negotiations, leading to the meeting of the two emperors at Tilsit in July.</p>

<p>Madden: Hugo’s poem “Le Cimetière d’Eylau” tells the story of [Louis Hugo’s] heroic stance.</p>

<p>Madden: The scorched-earth tactic of the Russians made the taking of Moscow (September 1812) a Pyrrhic victory. Forced to retreat, the already weakened Grande Armée was trapped, on November 26, between a pursuing Russian force and the Beresina River, where the ice proved too weak to support the planned passage of the army. As the engineering corps raced to fashion a bridge, more than 10,000 French troops were killed, either by drowning or by Cossacks.</p>

</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: This perhaps should be Bar-le-Duc, some 130 miles east of Paris, close to St-Dizier, where Napoleon won his last victory on 26 March 1814. Hugo may be referring to events that took place near by at what is referred to as the second battle of Fère-Champenoise on 25 March 1814, in which some 3,500 young and inexperienced National Guardsmen were killed making a heroic stand under General Michel-Marie Pacthod (1764–1830), whose arm was shattered in the fighting. Arnay-le-Duc is 155 miles south-east of Paris, in Burgundy, and not on the route of the retreating army.</p>

    Eight days before the capitulation: <a href="#eight-days-before-the-capitulation">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Madden: General Marmont signed an armistice with the Allies at 2 A.M. on March 31, 1814; allied armies entered Paris later that day, while Napoléon retreated to Fontainebleau. On April 3, the imperial legislature pronounced Napoléon’s removal as emperor; on April 4, he abdicated, under the condition that his four-year-old son be recognized as Emperor Napoléon II, under the regency of Empress Marie-Louise; the Allies refused his conditions; on April 6, Napoléon abdicated unconditionally while his senate, under the leadership of Talleyrand, voted a proclamation recognizing Louis XVIII as king of the French.

</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: In response to a letter he had received from the Marquis Charles-Louis-Alexandre de Coriolis d’Espinouse (1770–1841) Hugo wrote a poem entitled ‘Écrit en 1846’ (Written in 1846), published in his collection <em>Les Contemplations</em> of 1856: ‘Marquis, je m’en souviens, vous veniez chez ma mère, / Vous me faisiez parfois réciter ma grammaire …’ (‘Marquis, I remember, you used to visit my mother, / You sometimes made me recite my grammar …’).</p>

</h4>
    
<p>Madden: this crowded salon is something of a reflection of the atmosphere the adolescent Victor Hugo grew up in. Madame Hugo liked to blame her failed marriage on her royalist principles, and if the company she kept was far less grand than Madame de T——’s guests (Beauffremont, Clermont-Tonnerre, and la Luzerne are some of the great names of the old aristocracy), the Revolution and Empire were vilified by Hugo’s mother and her friends. While most of the baroness’s guests are real people, only those who played some larger role in history or Hugo’s life are discussed here. As the title of the chapter makes clear, Madame de T—— and her guests are living relics of another time.</p>

<p>Donougher: The ultra-royalist Chamber of Deputies elected in August 1815 was referred to by Louis XVIII as ‘introuvable’ (‘unfindable’), meaning that he could not have found a more royalist Chamber if he had tried. When the extremism of the ‘introuvable’ Chamber became a threat to the survival of the monarchy, the Assembly was dissolved by the king, in September 1816, and new elections returned more moderates.</p>

</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: The county of Ferrette in Alsace came under the jurisdiction of Austria in 1324 and was ruled by a royal official known as the <em>bailli</em> (‘bailiff’) de Ferrette. In <em>La Muse du Département</em>, set in 1820s and 30s, Balzac writes of the bailiff that he was said to be ‘l’homme le plus courageux de l’Europe parce qu’il osait marcher sur ses deux jambes’ (‘the bravest man in Europe for daring to walk on his legs’); and that he was accused ‘de mettre du plomb dans ses souliers, pour ne pas être emporté par le vent’ (‘of putting lead in his shoes to save himself from being blown away’).</p>

<p>Madden: Talleyrand, a rich European celebrity, had a house that was a gathering place for those elements of Parisian high society who were less ideological than Madame de T—— and her guests. For an old libertine like the bailiff of Ferrette, Talleyrand’s house would have been far more agreeable.</p>

    Aristotle … Campaspe … La Guimard: <a href="#aristotle--campaspe--la-guimard">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: The story arose in the thirteenth century that when the philosopher Aristotle remonstrated with his pupil Alexander the Great for allowing himself to be distracted from more important things by his mistress, she took her revenge by using her charms to make Aristotle fall in love with her, to the point where he allowed her to ride on his back. When challenged about his behaviour, the philosopher replied that he had proved precept by example: if a man of his age and wisdom could be made a fool of by a woman, how much more dangerous must she be to a young man? While Pliny the Elder wrote in his <em>Natural History</em> that Campaspe was a favourite mistress of Alexander’s, the woman who seduced Aristotle is more usually given the name Phyllis. George Sarton in an article published in 1930 (‘Aristotle and Phyllis’, <em>Isis</em>, vol. 14, no. 1, p. 13) cites a reference to a French parlour game called <em>le cheval d’Aristote</em> (‘Aristotle’s horse’), in which as a forfeit a man is obliged to crawl around the room on all fours with one of the ladies on his back.</p>

<p>Madden: According to a medieval legend, the Athenian courtesan Campaspe, or Phyllis, the mistress of Alexander the Great, seduced Aristotle and, as proof of his love, demanded that he allow her to ride his back while he crawled on all fours. For medieval moralists, this was a warning of the perfidy of woman, the dangers of desires of the flesh, and the arrogance of human intellect. “La Guimard” refers to one of the famous courtesans of the eighteenth century (see here).</p>

In 1824 he became minister of public education and ecclesiastical affairs, and delivered the funeral oration for Louis XVIII. In Flaubert’s <em>Madame Bovary</em> (pt 1, ch. 6) we read: ‘Le soir, avant la prière, on faisait dans l’étude une lecture religieuse. C’était, pendant la semaine, quelque résumé d’Histoire sainte ou les <em>Conférences</em> de l’abbé Frayssinous …’ (‘In the evening, before prayers, there would be a religious reading in the study.

Published over the years 1751–72 and expanded by successive editors, it was intended to be a comprehensive corpus of world knowledge to be made available to the reading public and to future generations.

<p>Donougher: The third-century-AD biographer of the Greek philosophers Diogenes Laertius tells us that Epimenides of Knossos fell asleep for fifty-seven years, and when he awoke after what he thought was a short nap he was bewildered by the changes that had taken place in the meantime.</p>

<p>Madden: Methuselah lived for 967 years, according to the book of Genesis, while in Greek legend, Epimenides fell asleep in a cave for fifty-seven years.</p>

<p>Donougher: Many of the royalist émigrés who fled France after the Revolution gathered in Koblenz in the Rhineland, where Louis XVI’s brothers the Comte de Provence (the future Louis XVIII) and the Comte d’Artois (later Charles X) had taken up residence, and where the Prince de Condé commanded an émigré army. In 1794 Koblenz fell to the Revolutionary army in the French Revolutionary Wars.</p>

<p>Donougher: The journalist and satirist Charles Colnet du Ravel (1768–1832) was an outspoken critic of Napoleon in the many articles that he wrote for a number of journals, and his bookshop, known as his <em>caverne</em>, became a meeting-place for other writers who shared his political opinions.</p>

</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: The Terror was instituted by a decree of 5 September 1793 authorizing the Revolutionary government to eliminate its enemies.</p>

<p>Donougher: The restoration of the Bourbon monarchy dates from 8 July 1815 when Louis XVIII made his entry into Paris.</p>

<p>Madden: an apparent reference to a decree of the Convention on September 5, 1793, which authorized the arrest of “suspects” practically on the whim of Revolutionary authorities, making noble status a virtual crime in itself. July 8, 1815, was the day Louis XVIII returned to Paris after Waterloo. In terms of both numbers and official persecutions, it is a gross exaggeration to compare the <em>Terreur blanche</em> to the <em>Terreur rouge</em> of 1793–94.</p>

<h4 id="the-congregation">
  
  
    The Congregation: <a href="#the-congregation">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: A religious association for clergy and laity; revived in 1814 by the Jesuit Pierre Ronsin (1771–1846) for the defence of Catholicism, the Congregation came to be closely allied with the royalist cause and politically influential.</p>

<p>Madden: The Chevaliers de la Foi, or Knights of Faith, a mostly aristocratic group committed first to the Church and second to politics, became an almost mythical force in the popular political imagination under the Restoration. The Congregation plays a large role in Stendhal’s <em>Le Rouge et le noir</em>—far larger, probably, than it ever played in fact.</p>

    the <em>Mémorial de Sainte-Hélène:</em> <a href="#the-mémorial-de-sainte-hélène">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: A journal published in 1823 concerning the private life and conversations of Napoleon as recorded by Emmanuel, Comte de las Cases (1766–1842), who accompanied Napoleon to St Helena and remained there with him until 1816. Las Cases wrote, under the pseudonym Lesage, a historical atlas first published in England in 1801.</p>

<p>Madden: Emmanuel de Las Cases served as an officer in the Napoleonic armies before following Napoléon to Saint Helena. Although ordered by the British to leave after a year, Las Cases had sufficient time to interview Napoléon and gather the notes he would use in composing the <em>Mémorial</em>, a hagiographic account of the Napoleonic epic. A huge success from the moment of its publication, the <em>Mémorial</em> was one of the most important factors in shaping Napoléon’s legend in the 1820s.</p>

<p>Madden: The bulletins were official accounts of the actions of Napoléon’s army. A key tool of imperial propaganda, the bulletins were sometimes praised for their writing; Hugo’s “Homeric stanzas” more likely refers to the content than the style. The bulletins were recognized as propaganda at the time; the saying “to lie like the bulletins” became common among soldiers.</p>

    Mirabeau … Danton: <a href="#mirabeau--danton">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Madden: some of the greatest figures of the Revolution. Mirabeau (1749–91) was the famous orator who dominated the Constituent Assembly. Pierre Vergniaud (1753–93) was one of the leading figures of the Girondist faction, moderate republicans who were eclipsed by the more radical Jacobins. Vergniaud was among those executed after the Jacobins triumphed in the spring of 1793. On Saint-Just, see here. Robespierre, the leader of the Jacobins, was overthrown in the coup of 9 Thermidor, July 28, 1794. On Desmoulins, see here. On Danton, see here.</p>

</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: Napoleon took a great interest in the theatre and was a particular admirer of the actor Talma, reportedly offering him advice on how men of power in the great tragedies should move on stage. The rumour that Napoleon was taking lessons in deportment from Talma is reflected in a cartoon of 1814 in which Napoleon is caricatured aping poses struck by the tragedian.</p>

<p>Madden: “ham actor” refers to the rumours that Napoléon had been taught how to perform in public by the actor Talma (see here).</p>

<p>Donougher: Contemporary rumours, much disputed, had it that when Napoleon withdrew from Jaffa in 1799 after the abortive Syrian campaign, he gave the order that wounded and plague-infected French troops should be administered fatal overdoses of opium, an allegation for which Walter Scott in his <em>Life of Napoleon Buonaparte</em> (1827) found ‘insufficient evidence’.</p>

<p>Madden: The legend of the “poisoner of Jaffa” refers to the Egyptian campaign of 1798–99. Napoléon supposedly poisoned the well at a camp in Jaffa (Haifa) in order to eliminate sick soldiers who were slowing his retreat after encountering an overwhelming Turkish force.</p>

<p>Madden: some of the most powerful rulers of France. Charlemagne (ca. 750–814), the first Holy Roman emperor, is claimed by the French as a king. Louis XI (born 1423, reigned 1461–83), the Spider King, patiently and ruthlessly consolidated royal power in the wake of the Hundred Years’ War. Hugo helped promote the legend of Louis XI in <em>Notre-Dame de Paris</em>. Henri IV was the first Bourbon king and the grandfather of Louis XIV (born 1638, reigned 1643–1715). Cardinal de Richelieu (1585–1642), the loyal and ruthless prime minister of Louis XIII, worked to strengthen the monarchy. The Committee of Public Safety was the executive component of the Convention, the means through which Robespierre ruled the country.</p>

<p>Madden: The Italian Carbonari also formed as a resistance movement in response to the rule of Joachim Murat around 1810. Carbonari groups formed in different parts of Italy, demanding greater liberalism and—in the north—combating Austrian influence. In Savoy and Naples, Carbonari succeeded in forcing the monarchs to grant constitutions. Ironically, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte was a member of the Carbonari before becoming heir to his uncle’s throne and Hugo’s nemesis.</p>

<p>Donougher: Of renowned beauty, Antinous (<em>c.</em>111–30) was the favourite of the Roman emperor Hadrian (76–138). After the youth, believed to have been his lover, died, Hadrian deified him, and his image abounded in statuary and on coins.</p>

<p>Donougher: Montfaucon was for centuries the site of a gallows where executed criminals were left to hang until their bodies decomposed.

<p>Donougher: The poet Théodore Agrippa d’Aubigné (1552–1630) was also a man of action, who fought with the Protestant army in the Wars of Religion. In 1620 his religious position eventually obliged him to leave France and take refuge in Geneva. Françoise d’Aubigné (1635–1719), the future Madame de Maintenon, mistress and then wife of Louis XIV, was his granddaughter.</p>

<p>Madden: Agrippa d’Aubigné (1552–1630) was a Huguenot poet who drew on his knowledge of the Bible to compose poetic laments on France torn apart by the Wars of Religion.</p>

<p>Madden: the first of three partitions of Poland in the eighteenth century by Russia, Prussia, and Austria (“that crime of three”). Upon the third partition, in 1795, Poland ceased to exist. At the Congress of Vienna, Czar Alexander I declared that a free Poland was a mortal threat to Russia and essentially annexed the country. Hugo called for a free Poland in one of his first speeches before the Chamber of Peers, in 1846.</p>

<p>Donougher: In June 1820 parliamentary debate on proposed electoral changes intended to increase conservative representation by means of the ‘double vote’ (only the most highly taxed would be eligible to vote for a second college of deputies at the <em>département</em> level) led to disturbances in Paris in which the medical student Nicolas Lallemand (1787–1820) was killed by a royal guard, further heightening tensions and fuelling protests.</p>

<p>Madden: During a demonstration against a new law concerning the voting franchise (in June 1820, not 1822), a young student named Lallemand was shot on the place du Carrousel; his funeral subsequently turned into a thousands-strong rally, with an even larger crowd joining a demonstration afterwards.</p>

<p>Donougher: After Napoleon was proclaimed emperor in 1804 he chose the eagle (<em>l’aigle</em>), with its associations with Rome and Charlemagne, as the emblem for the imperial coat of arms. He was himself referred to as <em>l’Aigle</em>, and his son was known as <em>l’Aiglon</em>, ‘the young eagle’. <em>L’aigle</em> and Lesgle are pronounced exactly the same. An animal’s mouth is a <em>gueule</em>, and the word is used in various hunting expressions, so the term <em>les gueules</em> refers to the hunting dogs.</p>

A gifted writer and orator, Bossuet was a staunch supporter of both Catholic orthodoxy and royal power. The Te Deum is a mass of thanksgiving in the Catholic Church. While Bossuet sought to bring Protestants back to the Catholic Church, the government often took more violent measures such as G—— alludes to. Dragonnades refers to a policy by which Protestants were forced to provide lodging to soldiers (specifically dragoons, the cavalry), who were tacitly encouraged to harrass their hosts into converting, often resulting in violence. More than two hundred thousand French Protestants, or Huguenots, fled France as a result of such policies.</p>

</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: Castor and Pollux are the heavenly twins of Greek and Roman mythology. An important theme in Homer’s <em>Iliad</em> is the friendship between Achilles and Patroclus, who is killed in battle by Hector (bk XVI). In the <em>Aeneid</em> (bk IX, lines 176–446) Virgil tells of the dangerous mission that the Trojan warriors Nisus and Euryalus embark on to find Aeneas, and how, rather than make good his escape alone, Nisus chooses to die with his friend Euryalus at the hands of their enemies (a theme revisited by Byron). The story of Eudamidas, told by Lucian of Samasota (second century AD), cited by Montaigne in his essay <em>On Friendship</em> and depicted in a painting by Poussin that was much admired in the eighteenth century, is that of a man who, being poor, bequeaths in his will to his two friends Aretheus and Charixenus the legacy of taking care of his elderly mother and unmarried daughter. When Alexander the Great’s closest friend and companion from childhood Hephaestion died of a fever, classical sources tell us, Alexander was inconsolable. Jean de Pechméja (1741–85), author of <em>Télephe</em>, a classically inspired Utopian novel published in 1784, was a childhood friend of Léon Dubreuil (1743–85), doctor to the Marquis de Noailles’s household, who fell ill with a contagious disease and asked that only Pechméja should tend him. They died within a few weeks of each other, their mutual devotion hailed by contemporaries as a model of friendship.</p>

<p>Madden: a reference to some legendary male friendships. Pollux with Castor, Patroclus with Achilles, Nisus with Euryale (in The <em>Iliad</em>), Eudamidas was the friend of Charixane in the work of the Roman poet Lucian. The modern example is Jean de Pechméja (1741–85), who was so devoted to his friend Dr. Dubrueil that he cared for the doctor through a fatal and contagious illness and died two weeks after the doctor did.</p>

When Orestes returned to his homeland to avenge his father’s murder at the hands of his wife and her lover, Pylades encouraged his friend not to falter in avenging his father by killing his mother.</p>

<p>Madden: Jean-Jacques Rousseau and his mistress, Thérèse Levasseur. The “little creatures” refers to the five children they had, all of whom, according to a legend started by Rousseau himself, were abandoned by their father at a foundling hospital.</p>

<p>Donougher: Built at Heidelberg Castle in 1751 to contain wine paid in taxes to the Elector Palatine by local wine growers, it has a capacity of over 58,000 gallons. Mark Twain in <em>A Tramp Abroad</em> (Appendix B) wrote: ‘the great Heidelberg Tun … is a wine-cask as big as a cottage, and some traditions say it holds eighteen hundred thousand bottles, and other traditions say it holds eighteen hundred million barrels. I think it likely that one of these statements is a mistake, and the other is a lie. However, the mere matter of capacity is a thing of no sort of consequence, since the cask is empty, and indeed has always been empty, history says. An empty cask the size of a cathedral could excite but little emotion in me. I do not see any wisdom in building a monster cask to hoard up emptiness in, when you can get a better quality, outside, any day, free of expense.’</p>

<p>Donougher: The French zoologist Pierre-André Latreille (1762–1833) was a leading entomologist who made important contributions to the classification of insects, including that of the woodlouse, a crustacean in the order of isopoda. Pterygibranchia is a now defunct term for a particular subclass of isopod crustaceans, and is not to be confused with Pterobranchia, a class, established in 1877, of worm-like creatures that live on the ocean floor.</p>

<p>Donougher: The murder of the Huguenot leader Admiral Gaspard de Coligny (1515–72), a man of integrity and valour, marked the beginning of the St Bartholomew’s Day massacre of Protestants by Catholics in August 1572, and the subsequent exodus of Huguenots from France. The Athenian general Phocion the Good (<em>c</em>.402–318 BC), described by Plutarch as a good man devoted to the state, was falsely accused of treason, executed, and denied the rites of burial.</p>

<p>Madden: Phocion was the elected leader (strategos) of Athens at the time of the Macedonian expansion by Philip and Alexander; he was executed for treason after he advocated cooperation with the Macedonians.

The southern American states mistakenly believed that their supply of cotton guaranteed European support in the event of war. In the words of James Henry Hammon of South Carolina, in 1858: ‘No, you dare not to make war on cotton. No power on earth dares to make war upon it. Cotton is king.’</p>

    Echo, plaintive nymph: <a href="#echo-plaintive-nymph">#</a>

Berlioz published an arrangement of the song in 1819. The story of the nymph and the reason for her plaintiveness is told in Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em>, bk III, lines 359–401. Grantaire is picking up on the last two syllables of Bossuet’s disquisition ending in singsong legalese: ‘contrats domaniaires et domaniaux, hypothécaires et hypothécaux’ (<em>-écaux</em>, pronounced ‘echo’).</p>

Contiguous with Vaud is the French district of Gex, the town of Gex lying some five miles west of the southern end of Lake Geneva. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna debated making Gex part of the Swiss Confederation. Under the final Treaty of Paris, France had to cede the six communes of the Gex region that linked Geneva with Vaud, but retained Gex.</p>

Cybele was worshipped by the Phrygians in Asia Minor as a mother goddess, <em>matar kubileya</em> (‘mother of the mountain’), from which the Greek name Cybele is thought to derive. The cult spread from Phrygia to Rome, and she came to be frequently depicted on Roman coins wearing a turreted city-wall head-dress.</p>

<p>Donougher: Io was a priestess seduced by Jupiter, who turned her into a white heifer, hoping to hide and protect her from his jealous wife. The story is told in Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em> (bk I, lines 567–746). Pissevache, meaning ‘pissing cow’, hence the connection with Io, is a waterfall in the Swiss Alps. Because waters have been diverted for hydroelectric purposes, it is not quite as dramatic as it used to be when celebrated by Romantic writers, including Goethe.</p>

<p>Madden: The nymph Io was a daughter of the river god Inachus; Pissevache is a waterfall in the French Alps.</p>

    The July Revolution: <a href="#the-july-revolution">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: Charles X succeeded his brother Louis XVIII in 1824, and became increasingly unpopular as a result of his attempts to circumvent constitutional limitations on the monarchy that culminated in the introduction, on the basis of Article 14, of the July Ordinances, suppressing the freedom of the press, dissolving the Chamber of Deputies, restricting the franchise and holding new elections (only months after elections had returned an increased liberal majority). This led to a popular uprising known as Les Trois Glorieuses (‘the three glorious days’) at the end of July 1830. Charles X fled Paris, and in his absence a political consensus was reached whereby the Duc d’Orléans, Louis-Philippe, of a cadet branch of the Bourbon family, was invited to become king.</p>

<p>Madden: In July 1830, Charles X and his ministers attempted to push through a number of restrictive laws, most notably against freedom of the press, that provoked an uprising in Paris. Within three days (<em>Les Trois glorieuses</em>) it became clear that the government could not survive. Charles abdicated, and his son the duc d’Angoulême renounced his right to succession. An interim government offered the throne of a constitutional monarchy to Louis-Philippe d’Orléans.</p>

They were involved in hiding from the police (unsuccessfully, in the end) her lover General Lahorie after he was found guilty of conspiracy against Napoleon (<em>Victor Hugo raconté par un témoin de sa vie</em> – the biography, published in 1863, written by Hugo’s wife Adèle, ch. 6).</p>

<p>Madden: General Bellavesne (1770–1826) lost a leg to a cannonball—Marius could not have visited him in the early years of the July Monarchy. General Baron Fririon (1766–1840) retired from combat in 1811 and was later named governor of the Hôtel des Invalides.</p>

    <em>Carnot … Fouché</em>: <a href="#carnot--fouché">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: In 1815 the treacherous and self-serving Fouché yet again betrayed his colleagues – in particular, Carnot, the man of integrity – by colluding with the restoration of Louis XVIII. This resulted in Carnot being exiled and Fouché becoming the new minister of police. This exchange is recorded in Fouché’s own posthumously published memoirs (1824; authorship is somewhat contested).</p>

<p>Madden: a famous exchange between Carnot (see here) and Fouché (see here) during Fouché’s brief period of influence following the Second Restoration in 1815. Fouché had persuaded the comte d’Artois and a few other Ultras that only a former Jacobin could purify France of its remaining Jacobins. Carnot was among the former colleagues of the Convention, Directory, and Empire that Fouché ordered into exile, before the Ultras procured his exile in turn.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lazare Carnot (1753–1823) was famous for his integrity and his republican convictions; having rallied to Napoléon during the Hundred Days, he was banished by the Bourbons. Nicolas-Jean de Dieu Soult (1769–1851) was named marshal of France and duc de Dalmatie by Napoléon; minister of war during the Hundred Days, he was exiled from 1815 to 1819, and eventually enjoyed a successful political career under Louis-Philippe.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another of the legendary figures of the era, Joseph Fouché (1763–1820) made his name as a ruthless enforcer of Revolutionary politics and policies (including overseeing the execution of more than a thousand “counterrevolutionaries” in barely three months). He ruthlessly enforced official atheism under the Convention. This reputation and a talent for espionage made Fouché the powerful minister of police for the Directoire and most of the Napoleonic empire. During the Hundred Days, Fouché played the royalists against the imperialists until deciding to side with the Bourbons. The Bourbons’ gratitude to the regicide did not last, however, and Fouché died in Trieste in 1821 after five years of exile from France. Contrary to legend, Fouché was a lay teacher in an Oratorian school and never took holy orders.</p>

<h4 id="hernani">
  
  
    <em>Hernani</em>: <a href="#hernani">#</a>
  
  
</h4>
    
<p>Donougher: Hugo’s play of 1830, which created a literary revolution – and gave rise to a celebrated ‘battle’ between rival literary factions on the opening night – by presenting a direct challenge to the old cultural establishment. In the name of the new Romantic sensibility it broke with classical theatrical traditions such as the unities of time, place and action, embracing less formal language and characteristic antitheses – the beautiful and the grotesque, the noble-hearted bandit, the pure love of a fallen woman.</p>

<p>Madden: With tongue in cheek, Hugo mocks the reaction to his own play of 1830, which was enormously controversial for its complete break with the traditions of French theatre (hence, “not even written in French!”). The antithesis was one of Hugo’s favourite literary devices.</p>

Initially a supporter of Bonaparte, he became a critic of the Empire under the influence of his lover, Madame de Staël, and both were exiled in 1803. In 1815, Napoléon asked him to draft a new constitution for the Empire as a gesture to liberals. After the Bourbons returned, his political activity was limited to the opposition press. He is best remembered today for his novel Adolphe, an autobiographical account of his affair with Madame de Staël.</p>

<p>Donougher: Hugo’s poem reads: ‘Un jour, maigre et sentant un royal appétit, / Un singe d’une peau de tigre se vêtit / … Chacun, voyant la peau, croyait au personnage. / Il s’écriait, poussant d’affreux rugissements: / Regardez, ma caverne est pleine d’ossements; / Devant moi tout recule et frémit, tout émigre, / Tout tremble; admirez-moi, voyez, je suis un tigre! / Les bêtes l’admiraient, et fuyaient à grands pas. / Un belluaire vint, le saisit dans ses bras, / Déchira cette peau comme on déchire un linge, / Mit à nu ce vainqueur, et dit: Tu n’es qu’un singe!’ (‘One day, thin and feeling a royal appetite, / A monkey dressed up in a tiger’s skin / … Everyone seeing the skin gave credence to the image. / He cried out with terrible roars, / Look, my cave is full of bones, / Everything retreats before me and quakes, everything emigrates, / Everything trembles. Admire me, look, I’m a tiger. / The animals admired him and fled. / A lion-tamer came, grabbed it in his arms, / Tore this skin asunder, as one might tear a sheet, / Stripped this conqueror naked, and said: You’re just a monkey!’).</p>
