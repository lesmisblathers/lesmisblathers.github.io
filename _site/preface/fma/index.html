    <p><em>Les Misérables</em> is a vast novel built to the measure of Victor Hugo’s humanity and vision. The culminating work of his long career, it was published in 1862, when the author was sixty. An instant success with the public, the book has stood since then as a masterpiece of fiction, both for the emotional intensity of its dramatic story and for a richness that defies any simple description. Undoubtedly readers come to the book for the deeply engrossing characters and stay on, as the author himself predicted, for the wider social and historic panorama.</p>

<p>The political timing of the publication was auspicious. Isolated by exile from the empire of Napoleon III, whose authoritarianism was relaxing as his effectiveness and popularity were waning, Hugo found a ready audience for his progressive fervor. Despite his long list of works in poetry, fiction, and drama, Hugo had been most widely known before this novel as a public figure, defender of the national conscience. And now, homesick for France but unwilling to accept the amnesty offered by the emperor he despised, he was eager for the chance to remind France at large of his presence.</p>

<p>A friend reported to him that all of Paris was raving about the book. As for the critics, Hugo clearly took it as a compliment that his liberal views had enraged the reactionary, the conservative Catholic, and the Bonapartist journals. The gratifying enthusiasm of the younger critics, however, was not unanimously sustained, for the book had appeared outside of its time. When he began writing it in 1845, the Romantic traditions of intense sentiment and crusading idealism were prevalent. François-René de Chateaubriand, Alphonse de Lamartine, George Sand, and Honoré de Balzac were the literary leaders. By the time <em>Les Misérables</em> appeared almost twenty years later, however, the despair of Gustave Flaubert’s <em>Madame Bovary</em> and the rich decadence of Baudelaire’s <em>Les fleurs du mal</em> were already part of the literary climate. A new group, the Realists, objected to what they saw as Hugo’s excesses of sentiment and rhetoric, and disparaged the poetic and humanitarian idealism that interfered with the credibility of his scenes.</p>

<p>And yet, rising above the fluctuations of literary criticism, the book has always retained a powerful hold on the public, and writers have continued to turn to Hugo for inspiration. Diverse authors such as Arthur Rimbaud, Stéphane Mallarmé, and Paul Claudel were influenced by this giant of Romanticism. André Gide called him the greatest master of images and sonorities, of symbols and language forms, in all of French literature.</p>

<p align="center">* * *</p>

<p>Hugo was born in 1802, during Napoleon’s rule as First Consul, and was to experience all the social upheaval and radical swings of French political life through the coming of the Third Republic in 1870 and beyond. His early childhood was spent in Italy, Spain, and many different parts of France, as the family of five went from one post to the next following the father, Léopold Hugo, a career officer made a count and then a general under Napoleon. Seriously buffeted by the discord between mismatched parents, the young Victor and his older brothers, Abel and Eugène, joined their mother in Paris when the couple separated. There Victor’s fondest memories were of an apartment on the Impasse des Feuillantines whose huge walled garden was a place of idyllic happiness, where he and Eugène both fell in love with the young Adèle Foucher, later Victor’s bride.</p>

<p>With his mother he attended Royalist salons, and attitudes learned there were part of his thinking until a reconciliation with his father led him on to a Napoleonic fervor. Gifted in languages, Hugo began to write poetry as a boarding student in Paris, where he grew to admire the great Romantic writer and statesman Chateaubriand. He continued to write, and edited a conservative literary journal with Eugène, while ostensibly studying law to please his father. Hugo gained considerable notice for his early fiction and particularly for his poetry, but it was as a playwright that he made his first assault on the literary barricades. His own Romantic manifesto, contained in a celebrated preface to his play <em>Cromwell,</em> declared war on prevailing Classical restrictions in favor of freer, more realistic forms and characterizations. Two years later, in 1830, with a carefully orchestrated riot in the audience on its opening night, his play <em>Hernani</em> won a place for Romantic drama. It also brought him financial success and the acknowledged leadership of the young Romantics, including Balzac, Alexandre Dumas, Gérard de Nerval, and Hugo’s closest friend, Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve.</p>

<p>Hugo married Adèle Foucher in 1823, “when together their ages did not add up to forty” (to paraphrase the poem recited at the barricade by the students on page 1102). By 1831 he was the father of four children and a figure in public demand. In that year he suffered a deep personal blow when Adèle formed a liaison with Sainte-Beuve. Crushed, Hugo himself soon took up with a young actress, Juliette Drouet, in an intense companionship that was to last fifty years. For the rest of his life an abiding ambivalence propelled Hugo to seek out romantic conquests while at the same time maintaining a longing for innocence, the side of him that appears in his fiction. This ambivalence, combined with his willing stance of genius, made him a difficult man to live with. Though he could be intensely generous, his divided attention left none of his various households completely satisfied.</p>

<p>As a young man Hugo received honors from three kings, was awarded the Légion d’Honneur and elected to the august Académie Française, but his temperament was not suited to a safe career under royal patronage. The protagonists of his verse dramas, outcasts combating corrupt or unjust power, caused the royal banning of two productions. The failure of a final play, <em>Les Burgraves,</em> brought a virtual end to his dramatic career in 1843.</p>

<p>In 1845 he began to write a book called <em>Les Misères.</em> In the same year Louis-Philippe, the so-called bourgeois king, made him <em>pair de France,</em> with a title for life and a seat in the upper legislative body. From then on, his life, writing, and politics were inseparable, linked by his firm belief in the civilizing obligation of the poet. His first speeches were against the death penalty and against the horrifying prison conditions he had observed. He urged the adoption of laws to improve the lot of women, recommending universal free education and general suffrage as the means to relieve poverty. Though his political position was confused by a lingering attachment to Bonapartism and monarchy—they too had their Romantic appeal—he matched with an evolving credo of his own the nation’s painful struggle toward the equality and well-being promised by the revolution of 1789.</p>

<p>The writing went smoothly for Hugo until the massive uprising of 1848 that unseated Louis-Philippe and brought on the short-lived Second Republic. Then, at the chapter called “The Blotter Talks” (page 1145), he abruptly left off writing for a full-time role in politics. During the rebellion Hugo was a conspicuous figure, plunging fearlessly into angry crowds, speaking for conciliation. As a conservative deputy for Paris he advocated the presidency of Louis-Napoleon. But in the continuing governmental chaos, he made an abrupt switch to the left, finally aligning his politics with the humanitarian principles he had always advocated.
For his opposition to the coup d’état by which Napoleon III became emperor, Hugo was forced to flee through Belgium to the British Channel Islands, an exile that would last twenty years. His continued political agitation, including satires aimed at “the little Napoleon,” required a further move from Jersey to Guernsey, with a trunk of manuscripts, among them <em>Les Misérables,</em> almost lost overboard on the way.</p>

<p>In 1843—already rocked by the deaths of both his parents, of an infant son, and of his brother Eugène, who had gone mad on Victor’s wedding day—the writer suffered a permanently devastating loss. At nineteen his adored eldest daughter, Léopoldine, drowned with her husband in a boating accident. It was a shock that effectively divided his life into “before” and “after.” He gradually confronted his grief in what was probably his greatest series of lyric poems, <em>Les Contemplations,</em> which was released for publication five years into his island existence.</p>

<p>The years of exile encouraged other contemplations as well. Gazing back at the troubled shores of France, Hugo filled sketchbooks with paintings of mystic landscapes; he explored the occult; and he published the first part of a monumental work, projected as an epic history of mankind.</p>

<p>In 1860, he finally returned to <em>Les Misérables,</em> the book he had never expected to complete, and wrote through to the end. Then, in a move quite uncharacteristic of this writer, who preferred to move forward rather than revise, he went back to insert many sections that brought the book into line with his liberalized views and perspectives gained offshore. In one of his rare trips back to the mainland, he went to Belgium. There, writing the Waterloo section last, he finished <em>Les Misérables</em> beside the actual battlefield, in Mont-Saint-Jean. He was certain that he had created a masterpiece.</p>

<p>With the downfall of Napoleon III in 1870, Hugo returned to Paris. He received a hero’s welcome as the champion of democracy, delivering four separate speeches to the huge crowd gathered at the railway station. It was the so-called “terrible year,” dominated by the rout of the French army and a German siege of Paris. When peace was restored, he served as a senator under the more stable Third Republic, continuing his appeals for progress and mercy.
Hugo lived on like one of the old men he drew so perceptively, curiosities because they have lasted beyond their time. Having outlived his wife and Juliette Drouet, having outlived his two sons, he was left with only his institutionalized daughter, Adèle, and two well-loved grandchildren, about whom he wrote a fine book of poems, <em>The Art of Being a Grandfather.</em> His death in 1885 was nationally mourned; two million Frenchmen turned out for the procession that followed the casket from the Arc de Triomphe to the Panthéon.</p>

<p align="center">* * *</p>

<p>When Hugo first began writing <em>Les Misérables,</em> it was as if he had been gathering the material all his life. Many of the characters show traces of his own personal experience, and the book’s philosophical stance mirrors the concerns of his political existence. His first published story, of a black slave in Santo Domingo betrayed by an influential white friend, shows the same concern for outcasts that pervades the novel and that later led Hugo to plead for the life of the American abolitionist John Brown. Early research into prison conditions had produced two short fictional works, and around 1835, Hugo had investigated accounts of a bishop in the Midi who succored a released convict.</p>

<p>The principal action opens in 1815, the year Napoleon’s Hundred Days interrupted the reign of Louis XVIII, beginning with Napoleon’s triumphant return from Elba and ending in his defeat at Waterloo. By the story’s close eighteen years later, the last Bourbon king, Charles X, has given way to the constitutional monarchy of Louis-Philippe. It is in frustration against Louis-Philippe’s slow-moving regime that the students and workers are driven to the barricades at the book’s climax.</p>

<p>Very early, Hugo conceived of the book as the story of a saint, a man, a woman, and a little girl. The story begins with a rather leisurely section revealing Bishop Myriel’s gentle humor and sanctity. Then, in what may for many readers be the first strong indication of the book’s dramatic power, a confrontation takes place between the churchman and a dying pariah, a former deputy to the Revolutionary Convention, which had sentenced Louis XVI to death (page 35). This highly emotional scene, followed by less intense, discursive chapters on the ecclesiastic attitudes of the times, demonstrates Hugo’s deliberate method of alternating dramatic action and passages of historic background, a process that produces an account of astonishing depth and clarity.</p>

<p>At the center of the narrative is Jean Valjean, a good man made a petty thief by poverty, whose life and dignity are restored by a bishop’s trust and by his own unselfish love for a little girl. Valjean’s progress is halting, marked by inward debate, by error, and by the unending flight from adversaries. Chief among these is Javert, the implacable police officer made dangerous by an obsessive sense of duty. At the same time Thénardier, the completely false innkeeper, not even a good criminal, stalks Valjean for his own evil gain. Much of the book’s suspense comes from their persistent tracking down of the outcast hero.
A second outcast, Fantine, who first appears as a trusting young seamstress (page 119), becomes the victim of bourgeois callousness. Only the longing innocence remains as desperation drives her to prostitution. In a sense of obligation to her, Valjean undertakes the care of her daughter, Cosette. Fantine’s child becomes the luminous center of Valjean’s life. Anyone aware of Hugo’s own parental loss will see a poignant source of Valjean’s all-consuming love for Cosette, his jealousy of Marius, and the terrible sacrifices he must make on her behalf.</p>

<p>A host of secondary figures repeatedly reveals Hugo’s delight in writing a character or scene for its own sake. It would be hard to forget the feisty royalist Monsieur Gillenormand, frozen in the attitudes and fashions of a bygone era, or the street urchin Gavroche, who lacks everything but seems to possess the city through his wit and insolence. Without an overt display of tight organization, the huge cast in fact moves very precisely toward the denouement.</p>

<p>The expository passages, a remarkable feature of the novel, deserve brief mention here through a couple of examples. The long sequence on the battle of Waterloo—that name which has passed into our language—beginning on page 299 is justly famous for the brilliance of its sweeping panorama highlighted by ironic detail, and for the analysis of the battle’s role, as European history wheeled and turned. The protest occasionally heard, that the sequence has little to do with the plot, overlooks the wider scope of the book, which Baudelaire called “the legend of the nineteenth century.”</p>

<p>A very different sort of chapter added to “Fantine” from exile, “The Year 1817” (page 113), catalogs a random series of seeming trivia that caught the Parisian fancy, or failed to, during a brief span of euphoria in that year. Here we see such things as the Napoleonic N being erased from the Louvre and Chateaubriand dictating to his secretary every morning as he stood in front of his window cleaning his teeth. It scarcely matters that many of the names and events recalled by Hugo so much later are now unknown, some even incorrect. Like references throughout the book, they are there for the tone they help to set; the sharp contrasts and dismissive attitudes in the chapter convey a strong sense of misplaced public values.</p>

<p>One of the book’s particular joys is Hugo’s contagious love of Paris, the center and symbol of France, first described in terms of its people, who are seen as wrong-headed at times, but always resourceful and witty. Obvious affection is also lavished on the physical city, the landmarks and streets where much of the action unfolds. Hugo follows the characters through their winding itineraries, mentioning each street by name. For instance, there is Marius’ progress toward the barricade from the rue Plumet—across the Pont des Invalides and down the Champs-Élysées, through what was then the Place Louis XV and is now the Place de la Concorde, past the fashionable strollers on the Rue de Rivoli and on into the pitch-black battle zone near the markets.</p>

<p>Today, though the custom of renaming Paris thoroughfares for new heroes continues, there has been for some time an Avenue Victor-Hugo in the sedate sixteenth arrondissement. And much else remains as history performs new scenes on old sets. Couples stroll through the same Jardin du Luxembourg; a metro stop almost under the site of the barricade at Corinth bears the name of Les Halles (though that great central market has now given way to a subterranean shopping mall); and a brief tour of the Paris sewers begins across the Seine, one bridge away from the shore where Valjean emerged with his unconscious burden. Paris ways persist, for the student uprising of May 1968 saw modest versions of the same barricades constructed of overturned vehicles and paving blocks, though muskets and artillery were replaced by tear gas and fire hoses.</p>

<p>Reading <em>Les Misérables</em> today, nobody would deny that Victor Hugo’s prodigious flow of words occasionally produces moments of excess, when we might wish he had shown more restraint. But to Albert Lacroix, the young Belgian who first published the book, the author refused cuts as he had to all other editors. He finally permitted the excision of one chapter on prostitution and woman’s lot, which, as the author would smile to see, now appears in some French editions as an appendix. While several abridged editions exist in English, that expedient seems a mistake. It is almost impossible to predict the individual detail, the flashing image or human quirk precisely observed, that will burn its way into a reader’s mind for good. The sound solution is to honor the author’s wishes. If the heightened rhetoric of elation and despair occasionally strains our patience or credulity, the quiet perception on the next page generally restores it.</p>

<p align="center">* * *</p>

<p>The classic translation done by Charles E. Wilbour was completed in time for publication by the A. L. Burt Company of New York in 1862, the same year the novel appeared in French, an incredible feat actually duplicated by several translators in various languages. An interesting figure, Wilbour trained as a lawyer, seems to have had some political connections, and translated two other books by his friend Hugo before turning to the study of Egyptology.</p>

<p>For this revised edition, our aim has been to move the phrasing and vocabulary forward, closer to contemporary usage and occasionally closer to what we take as the author’s intent, but never to lose the basic fabric, which is still Wilbour’s Hugo, the version that has endured.</p>
