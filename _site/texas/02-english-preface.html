<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
<p align="center"><em>Affectionately inscribed to Mattie Austin Hatcher, one time Archivist of the University of Texas, who first directed my attention to this story</em></p>

<p>The story of Champ d’Asile was brought to my knowledge a number of years ago by Mrs. Mattie Austin Hatcher, Archivist in The University of Texas. In response to my interest, Donald Joseph of the French Department of The University of Texas translated from the French three accounts of the ill-fated colony, hoping to publish them as a triology consisting of an historical narrative, a love story, and a semi-fictitious adventure. The plan came to naught chiefly because of literary faults in the originals, which Mr. Joseph did not feel at liberty to correct.</p>

<p>From this group, <em>L’Heroïne du Texas</em> is now selected and freely emended, as the most interesting for publication, adding, as it does, the charm of a Rousseauan love story to an historical document. It has, moreover, a strong claim to the title, <em>The First Texas Novel</em>.</p>

<p>The editor has made no attempt to relate Champ d’Asile to earlier French activities in Texas. That work is being done by an able scholar. The present volume is offered merely as a good story of a highly romantic and little known episode in Texas history: the futile attempt of a group of French exiles to found a Napoleonic state in the Southwestern wilderness.</p>

<p>Neither the author of the novel nor its hero and heroine have been identified from the available list of Champ d’Asile colonists. Hartmann and Millard, in <em>Le Texas du Notice Historique sur Champ d’Asile</em>, call the lovers Edward and Adrianne. So much does the Hartmann and Millard narrative add to the present story that an abbreviated version of it is given as a supplement or glorified footnote.</p>

<p>No material remains have been discovered to fix the site of Champ d’Asile. Tradition places it in the near vicinity of the present town of Liberty, a name inherited, it is claimed, directly from the French fort.</p>

<p>For help in preparing this brief and simple work thanks are due to Donald Joseph, the real “founder of the feast,” for the translation, despite many changes, is basically his; to W.E. Wrather for generous loans of his books on Champ d’Asile and the aquatints here reproduced; and to Joseph O. Naylor for his courteous release of the Introduction which was originally written for <em>The Epic Century</em>.</p>
