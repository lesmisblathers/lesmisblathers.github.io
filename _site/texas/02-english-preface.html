    <h2 id="english-edition-preface">English Edition Preface</h2>
<p>by Frances Ratchford, 1936</p>

<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
<p align="center"><em>Affectionately inscribed to Mattie Austin Hatcher, one time Archivist of the University of Texas, who first directed my attention to this story</em></p>

<p>The story of Champ d’Asile was brought to my knowledge a number of years ago by Mrs. Mattie Austin Hatcher, Archivist in The University of Texas. In response to my interest, Donald Joseph of the French Department of The University of Texas translated from the French three accounts of the ill-fated colony, hoping to publish them as a triology consisting of an historical narrative, a love story, and a semi-fictitious adventure. The plan came to naught chiefly because of literary faults in the originals, which Mr. Joseph did not feel at liberty to correct.</p>

<p>From this group, <em>L’Heroïne du Texas</em> is now selected and freely emended, as the most interesting for publication, adding, as it does, the charm of a Rousseauan love story to an historical document. It has, moreover, a strong claim to the title, <em>The First Texas Novel</em>.</p>

<p>The editor has made no attempt to relate Champ d’Asile to earlier French activities in Texas. That work is being done by an able scholar. The present volume is offered merely as a good story of a highly romantic and little known episode in Texas history: the futile attempt of a group of French exiles to found a Napoleonic state in the Southwestern wilderness.</p>

<p>Neither the author of the novel nor its hero and heroine have been identified from the available list of Champ d’Asile colonists. Hartmann and Millard, in <em>Le Texas du Notice Historique sur Champ d’Asile</em>, call the lovers Edward and Adrianne. So much does the Hartmann and Millard narrative add to the present story that an abbreviated version of it is given as a supplement or glorified footnote.</p>

<p>No material remains have been discovered to fix the site of Champ d’Asile. Tradition places it in the near vicinity of the present town of Liberty, a name inherited, it is claimed, directly from the French fort.</p>

<p>For help in preparing this brief and simple work thanks are due to Donald Joseph, the real “founder of the feast,” for the translation, despite many changes, is basically his; to W.E. Wrather for generous loans of his books on Champ d’Asile and the aquatints here reproduced; and to Joseph O. Naylor for his courteous release of the Introduction which was originally written for <em>The Epic Century</em>.</p>

The University of Texas</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>More than a century ago, and two years before Stephen F. Austin brought his first Anglo-Americans to the Brazos and Colorado Rivers, a Frenchman on the Seine wrote, apropos of a flood of publications hot from the press, “Texas has become a rich field for literature and anyone may exploit it.” He might have cited among a host of lesser tillers of the soil the poet Béranger and, a few years later, the novelist Balzac.</p>

<p>The occasion for the outburst was the founding of a colony of Napoleonic exiles on the bank of the Trinity River in the heart of the Texas wilderness. Such a demonstration of the Rousseauan doctrine of return to nature was enough in itself to excite the interest of romantic France: joined to patriotism and national pride it aroused an enthusiasm that swept the nation, expressing itself in public subscription, benefit performances at the theaters, literary productions, and pictorial delineations of imaginary scenes in the far-off colony. The settlement was a New World Utopia which roused exhausted France from the lethargy of Bourbon reaction to a momentary flash of youthful hope.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the episode that so excited the mother country and gave the diplomats of three nations some bad moments, making itself felt even in lonely St. Helena, has failed to find a place in the traditions of the land where it was enacted. Texas people and Texas literature have forgotten that Texas forests, lighted by the campfires of Napoleon’s Old Guard, once rang to shouts of “Vive L’Empereur.” Anglo-Texans have never sung, “The laurel grows in Champ d’Asile.” But for contemporary narratives the incident would be entirely lost. Those who would know the story must seek it, still in the mother tongue of the writers, on closely guarded shelves of collectors and in “rare book rooms” of public libraries.
What to do with the imperial officers was a problem confronting the restored Bourbon government at the end of the Hundred Days. Napoleon had chosen the United States of America as a place of retirement for himself and his family, and might easily have reached that land of refuge but for his indecision of action and his reluctance to accept the appearance of flight. Joseph Bonaparte, ex-King of Spain, was the only member of the family to enter the designated haven, he alone obtaining the passport necessary for leaving France.</p>

<p>The two, Napoleon and Joseph, were together at Roche-fort for a number of days before the Emperor “threw himself upon the generosity of the British nation,” by surrendering to Captain Maitland of the <em>Bellerophon</em>. In the course of that time Joseph exhausted in vain every persuasion to bring his brother to accept his passport and quarters in the brig <em>Commerce</em> which was to take him to America—the resemblance between the two being close enough to insure success of the exchange. It was not until after the <em>Bellerophon</em> had sailed that Joseph completed arrangements for his own departure for the United States.</p>

<p>The American brig, <em>Charleston</em>, of South Carolina, was chartered for himself and a small party formerly connected with Napoleon’s court. They sailed on July 25, 1815, and landed safely at New York on August 28. In America Joseph called himself Count de Surveilliers, though his identity was well known. After creating a small flurry in diplomatic circles by a not very persistent effort to obtain an interview with President Madison, he settled down for a few months in New York before he leased “Landsowne,” the Bingham estate on the Schuykill. Finding this too near Philadelphia and lacking the seclusion he sought, he purchased a farm of about two hundred acres, called “Point Breeze,” near Bordentown, New Jersey. On this estate, enlarged by successive purchases, he remained until his return to Europe in 1832, “living quietly and unostentatiously the life of a private citizen…” His home was the center of generous hospitality for all French exiles, and many are the stories of his kindness to even the humblest of his fellow countrymen. Around him the faithful rallied, and to him they paid the court once accorded his brother.</p>

<p>The fortunes of Napoleon’s followers in France fell into the shifty hands of that master of intrigue, Joseph Fouché, Duke of Otranto. On the second abdication of Napoleon he was elected President of the Provisional Commission, and was retained by Louis XVIII, as Minister of Police, for this disagreeable task. He it was who made up the first proscription list of about one hundred names, many of them his former colleagues, accomplices, and agents. Under the scrutiny of the King and his council the list was reduced to fifty-nine. As each name was confirmed, Fouché, with his usual double-dealing, perhaps this time with the sanction of the King, warned the victim and provided passports and money for escape. Only those who failed to accept the proffered warning were arrested. Among the refugees to America were five who became the leading spirits of the exiles, though their number included hundreds of lower rank, who for one reason and another had found it desirable to leave France: the brothers Lallemand, Charles the elder, who had begged and been refused permission to share Napoleon’s exile, and Henri; Marshal Grouchy, with his two sons, Colonels Alphonse and Victor; General Lefebvre-Desnouëttes; and General Rigaud.</p>

<p>Their reception in the United States was in the main kind and sympathetic. Earlier dislike of Napoleon was counterbalanced by the reactionary policy of the restored Bourbons, and the wave of good feeling that swept the country toward the end of Madison’s administration tended to replace political animosities with benevolent understanding. There were already in the country, particularly in Philadelphia and Baltimore, a goodly number of French refugees from the Negro insurrection in Santo Domingo of almost a quarter century earlier. These were, for the most part, in moderate circumstances, and they gave their countrymen a warm welcome which included hospitality and financial assistance to such as needed it. Some of the refugees brought considerable means with them, which they shared with the less fortunate. In the course of time, however, dependence became a burden to both donors and recipients. It was to the interest of all that the refugees become self sustaining. The Government was besought to give them homes in a climate similar to that of France, where they might cultivate the most familiar products of their country—the vine and the olive.</p>

<p>A company of the exiles was organized at Philadelphia in December, 1816, and members of their group were sent out to find a suitable situation for a colony. Acting on advice rather than first-hand investigation, they petitioned Congress to grant them a tract on the Tombigbee River, in the Mississippi Territory recently acquired by treaty from the Creek Indians. The request was granted on liberal terms: they were given four contiguous townships, each six miles square, at $2.00 per acre, to be paid over a period of fourteen years. The land was to be divided among two hundred and eighty settlers, no one to hold more than six hundred and forty acres. The society was to select its own agent.</p>

<p>General Charles Lallemand was chosen president of the group, which was variously styled “Society for the Cultivation of the Vine and Olive,” “The French Emigrant Society,” and “The Tombigbee Association.” The first group of settlers, about one hundred and fifty in number, left Philadelphia in December, 1817, and others followed late in April of the next year, taking with them vines and olive trees for planting.</p>

<p>The colony was a failure for the obvious reason that its members were soldiers unable to adapt themselves to civil pursuits. None among them knew anything of agriculture even in their own country, and all were entirely ignorant of conditions in their new homes. The bill of grant had been formulated with particular care to prevent speculation in the designated lands, but it utterly failed of its purpose. Money lenders owned most of the ground before the first of the exiles reached it. The only achievement of the colonists as a group was the laying out of a town called Aigleville, which proved to be outside their boundaries. And a fairly large and pretentious house built by the leader, General Lefebvre-Desnouttës, on his tract of five hundred acres was the only considerable improvement made by an individual. Near by the General built a log “sanctuary,” the shrine of a large bronze statue of Napoleon; “around its feet were swords and pistols which Desnouttës had taken in battle, together with beautiful flags, tastefully hung around the walls.” Desnouttës’ wife was a sister of the famous Parisian banker, La Fitte. From her he received large sums of money for France. It is said that he spent twenty-five thousand dollars in opening and cultivating his farm in Alabama.</p>

<p>By the end of the summer of 1818, the company was broken up, and most of its members back in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>General Charles Lallemand, the president of the company, in all probability, never visited the Tombigbee, for while that settlement was in formation, he was in New Orleans purchasing supplies for his own colony in Texas. His ambitions transcended a mere agricultural colony within the United States. That it included the rehabilitation of the Bonaparte fortunes in Latin America and the rescue of Napoleon from St. Helena was believed by many of his contemporaries. It is certain that those of the Old Guard in America never ceased to hope for Napoleon’s escape, and talked of it and planned for it each time they came together. No scheme was too absurd for their consideration. Just as the royal family of Portugal, driven from its throne by the usurpations of Napoleon, fled overseas to the colony of Brazil, so might Joseph Bonaparte, deposed king of Spain, set up his standard in the Spanish colonies of America until the way was open for his return to his European court. Once established on the throne of Mexico, he would rescue his brother.</p>

<p>The scheme was set forth in a letter from London in July, 1816, published in Nile’s Register, but denounced as false by the editor of the magazine. In the late summer of 1817, Hyde de Neuville, representative of the restored Bourbon government in Washington, came into possession of a disturbing set of papers apparently written by Lakenal, a proscribed regicide whom Lafayette had introduced to Jefferson as a “Member of the French Institute, Officer of the University, and Inspector-General of the new Metrical System, who abandons those functions and a handsome treatment to become a settler in the State of Kentucky.” These papers implied the existence in America of an association under the name of the “Napoleonic Confederacy,” conspiring to place Joseph Bonaparte in control of Mexico as King of Spain and the Indies.</p>

<p>The documents, with a note from De Neuville, were laid before President Madison, who instituted the desired investigation. De Neuville also informed Spanish Minister Onis of the plot against the Mexican possessions of the King of Spain, and Onis in his turn laid his complaint before the Secretary of State, hoping that the United States would not violate its treaty of neutrality with European powers by allowing the execution of such a plot within its borders.</p>

<p>An investigation failed to show that Joseph Bonaparte, or the <em>Count de Surveillers</em>, as he was called, had contributed either money or encouragement to the scheme. Lallemand, whose name had been connected with the affair, went to Washington and there obtained an interview with Secretary Adams, in which he denied acquaintance with Lakenal, as well as any knowledge of the alleged plot, the report of which, he surmised, had grown out of the project settlement on the Tombigbee River. The report, however, reached St. Helena by way of England and led to a stricter watch over the imperial prisoner.</p>

<p>On December 17, 1817, a few days after the departure of the Tombigbee colonists from Philadelphia, a second group of exiles under the leadership of General Rigaud, set sail on the schooner <em>Huntress</em> carrying a cargo that accorded strangely with the needs of an agricultural colony. Included were six hundred muskets, four hundred sabres, and twelve thousand pounds of powder. Nicolas Biddle of Philadelphia reported to President Monroe that the vessel carried one hundred and fifty men, chiefly Frenchmen, who had been disciplined and prepared by the Lallemands. It was said, Biddle wrote, that other vessels from other ports would join them at some point, most probably in the Gulf of Mexico. It was said also that the funds for the expedition were raised almost entirely from land given to the officers and men in Alabama, which they sold at $1.00 or $1.50 per acre, chiefly to French people of Philadelphia. In one of the narratives of the expedition it is stated that these supplies were bought “partly with the voluntary contribution of the colonists and partly with a donation of Joseph Bonaparte.”</p>

<p>A suspicion occurred to President Monroe, which he expressed to Biddle, that the expedition might in reality have been prompted by Spanish Minister Onis against the United States. Biddle was sure that this was not true, though he thought that the brothers Lallemand might be open to offers from Onis for their services with the Royalists.</p>

<p>The division of the expedition carried by the <em>Huntress</em> was under the command of General Rigaud, who was accompanied by his daughter. The ship sailed south from Philadelphia, rounded the Tortugas, and in the vicinity of New Orleans was visited by an officer of one of Jean Lafitte’s independent corsairs from Galveston Island. The meeting was altogether friendly, and the courtesies exchanged on board were continued on shore at Galveston, where the colonists remained for more than a month, waiting for the arrival of General Lallemand with supplies and recruits.</p>

<p>One of the narrators depicts Lafitte’s band as a bad lot: “freebooters gathered from among all the nations of the earth and determined to put into practice the traditions of the buccaneers of old. They gave themselves up to the most shameless debauchery and disgusting immorality, and only their chief by his extraordinary strength and indomitable resolution had the slightest control over their wild and savage natures. Thanks to him the pirates became harmless neighbors to the exiles, with whom they often exchanged words of political sympathy, crying amicably, ‘Long live Liberty!’”</p>

<p>Lallemand’s arrival with additional colonists in early March was hailed with delight; songs of glory were sung, and toasts were drunk to the fatherland and the friends who remained there, and to the good fortune and prosperity of the colony. The recruits showed a motley mingling of French exiles Tombigbee colonists and Santo Dominican refugees Spaniards, Poles, Mexicans, and Americans, with a sprinkling of ex-pirates. The company, now numbering about four hundred members, set out in high spirits for the chosen site on the Trinity River. Boats had been purchased from Lafitte—one narrator says ten, another twenty-four. A storm scattering the craft, most of them had to turn back to Galveston. One was wrecked, drowning five of the six men on board.</p>

<p>After three days of struggle on the water, the party came together at Point Perrey, there they decided to separate: one group of a hundred, led by Generals Lallemand and Rigaud, to continue the journey by land; the rest, under Colonel Charrasin, to bring up the supplies by boat, guided by Indians with whom the colonists had already established friendly relations, “thanks to a few bottles of rum and some knives and muskets.” The boats missed the mouth of the river and were six days in reaching the designated site “twenty leagues from the Gulf of Mexico.” In the meanwhile the overland party, having taken insufficient food with them, suffered cruelly. In their hunger they ate of a wild plant resembling lettuce (probably poke greens) which they found in the wood—all except Lallemand, Rigaud, and Dr. Mann, the surgeon. An hour after this ill-advised repast, every one who had tasted it, ninety-seven in number, “lay stretched on the ground in awful agony, wracked by the most terrible convulsions.” As they lay “pale and undone,” an Indian of the “Cochatis nation” appeared. The sight of the sufferers and uneaten portions of the herb told him the story. He disappeared into the forest and shortly returned with bunches of fruit. Pressing the juice from these into a vessel carried at his waist, he gave it to the sufferers to drink. “They soon began to stir and rise as if from a long painful fainting spell.”</p>

<p>On the sixth day the land party met the flotilla bearing provisions at the appointed place. They had been four days without food and were in an exhausted condition, but recovered rapidly.</p>

<p>The first concern of the united colonists was the erection of fortifications, followed as soon as possible by the building of private homes for the married men and higher officers.</p>

<p>The settlement was laid out on a circular plan, taking its direction from the four forts. The dwellings were built of trees of medium thickness, cut into lengths of from six to seven feet, driven into the ground close together, and the chinks filled with a mud plaster. Loop-holes were left in the walls, so that each dwelling might be used as a fortress in case of attack.
Their completion was marked by gay house warmings, when the men who built them fêted the mistresses, drinking to Texas, to the Sons of Glory, and to the happiness of the French people.</p>

<p>The settlement was called Champ d’Asile.</p>

<p>From this place General Lallemand issued a manifesto, dated May 11, 1818, in which he announced to the world the establishment of an agricultural colony, claiming “the first right given by God to man—that of settling in this country, clearing it, and using the produce which nature never refuses to the patient laborer”; and disclaiming any warlike intentions, except defense against attack.</p>

<p>The code of laws as drawn up “was founded on justice, friendship, and disinterestedness,” the fundamental principle being the obligation of mutual aid and protection. All property was held in common, and all looked “to the same end in making the colony prosper: the general happiness, which would rebound to the individual happiness of each.” Lallemand’s proclamation made a great noise in Europe, above all, in France, exciting the admiration of the Liberals and the sneers of the opposing party. <em>La Minerve</em>, a fortnightly review of the day opened a subscription list for the exiles which yielded approximately one hundred thousand francs.</p>

<p>Béranger contributed a highly romantic poem to the cause; a pamphlet written by Monsieur Shiritiar and published by Ladrocat, went through two editions; theatrical performances and various other benefits also brought in considerable money, not a cent of which reached the colonists.</p>

<p>The romantic nature of the exiles responded warmly to the natural beauty of their surroundings. The women transplanted flowers and cultivated them with care in gardens near their homes. They were particularly fond of the laurel, a “tree so beloved of the French that one might believe that it was for them alone that nature decorated the earth with it.” Its abundance in the Texas woods was taken as a good omen by the exiles, and one of their number, the wife of an officer, composed a song having for its refrain, “The Laurel Grows in Champ d’Asile.”</p>

<p>Far from cultivating the soil, the exiles, most of them totally ignorant of agriculture and uninterested in civil pursuits, were finding what diversion they could in military maneuvers after their hours of communal labor. They ate at a common mess, and bivouacked as if they were in an enemy’s country, all except the Generals, two or three superior officers, and the women, who had large and not uncomfortable cabins. The few who cultivated gardens were richly rewarded for their efforts.</p>

<p>Besides drilling, the men had hunting, fishing, and athletic games for amusement. To all these diversions the few women and children of the colony lent their presence, commending all efforts and applauding success. The echoes of Texas resounded with songs of love and glory, the favorite on every occasion being “The Laurel Grows in Champ d’Asile.”</p>

<p>Around the nightly campfire, kept burning to frighten away wild beasts, the men loved to pretend they were loungers in the arcades of the <em>Palais Royal</em>, enjoying the glories of Imperial victories. Lallemand sometimes joined them, and entertained them with scraps of his last conversations with the Emperor. At such times the wildest dreams took possession of their imaginations, and Texas vanished from their thoughts. “They were eager to serve under the Mexican flag and help that country to throw off the Spanish yoke, after which they could easily persuade the Mexicans to give them a fast sailer, with which they would storm the island of St. Helena, carry off the Emperor in triumph, and crown him ruler of Mexico.”</p>

<p>When such amusements as the camp itself could provide began to pall, Lallemand arranged a grand celebration in honor of a treaty made with several tribes of neighboring Indians, at which a deal of rum was distributed, until in a burst of drunken friendliness the Indians adopted Lallemand as a great chief and invested him “with the appropriate insignia of his new honors.”</p>

<p>But nothing could stay the catastrophe inherent in the situation. Just as the expedition was setting out General Lallemand had issued a proclamation, a copy of which he claimed to have sent Ferdinand VII of Spain, arrogantly announcing his intention to make a settlement in Texas whether it pleased the Spanish court or no.</p>

<p>No one should have been surprised when friendly Indians brought information that a Spanish army was on its way from San Antonio to expel the French as hostile intruders. Prudence prevailed, and the colonists decided to withdraw, rather than to fight. Their departure was saddened by the slaying of two of their number by Indians. The partially devoured, still quivering bodies, were recovered and given burial. Dropping a laurel branch in their graves was the final pageant of Champ d’Asile.</p>

<p>There were enough boats at hand to take the company as far as Galveston, where they again established themselves as neighbors to the pirates. There scurvy, dysentery, and fever broke out, aggravated by lack of medicine and scarcity of food, and again they were at the mercy of the outlaws who drove hard bargains for all they sold.</p>

<p>The United States since the purchase of Louisiana 1803 had maintained a more or less definitely asserted claim to Texas, growing out of the vagueness of the Louisiana boundary as defined in the several treaties between France and Spain before the United States acquired Louisiana. The Spanish Minister Onis could not, without admitting this claim, protest to the government of the United States against the landing of the Napoleonic refugees at Galveston, but he did complain to President Adams of the apparent violation of neutrality in allowing the <em>Huntress</em> to be armed and equipped, as he claimed, in an American port.</p>

<p>Adams, without answering Onis’ note, sent George Graham, chief clerk and acting Secretary of War during the last two years of Madison’s administration, to Galveston to find out what Lallemand’s expedition amounted to. Graham met the refugees from Champ d’Asile on Galveston Island, and he must have smiled sadly to himself at the Spanish Minister’s fear of this pathetic group. When he departed, after consultation with Lallemand, the General-in-Chief and his staff went with him as far as New Orleans for the purpose of securing relief for his colonists.</p>

<p>In Lallemand’s absence Rigaud assumed command of the disheartened and almost desperate company. The pinch of hunger grew more desperate every day. Many were saved from starvation only by the generosity of Lafitte. To add to the situation, an agent of the Spanish Government appeared with the demand that the miserable wanderers quit Galveston Island. They replied that they could not treat with him in the absence of Lallemand. Day after day the relief their chief promised them was delayed. Then came a furious storm and a flood, such as swept the island in 1900, submerging the camp and huts to a depth of five feet. The remaining stores of the refugees were destroyed, and their suffering became intense. Immediate departure was imperative. The “perfect union and harmony” which up to this time had existed in the group went to the winds and each began to think how he might save himself. “Some wanted to join the settlers on the island; others wanted to go to New Orleans, while still others thought of other American cities. France was the objective of most.”</p>

<p>A few of the group did join Lafitte’s band of pirates; many crossed to the mainland and proceeded on foot, some to Alexandria, Louisiana; others to Nacogdoches; but the majority walked the one hundred and fifty leagues to New Or-leans, supporting themselves solely by hunting. Those who remained behind, including Rigaud and his daughter, were furnished with a ship by Lafitte, together with such supplies as he could spare a prize captured from the Spanish, the <em>St. Anthony de Compeachy</em>—in which they finally reached New Orleans after a trying voyage.</p>

<p>From New Orleans most of the colonists returned to France; a few, it is said, joined the Spanish revolutionists.</p>

<p>General Charles Lallemand lived out the varied life of an adventurer and soldier of fortune, often in great poverty, until the Revolution of 1830 offered the chance to return to France —by Napoleon’s will he had been left one hundred thousand francs. In 1832 he took his seat in the French Council of Peers, and, as a just reward for his faithfulness to Napoleon, he became military commander of Corsica. He died at Paris in 1839. His younger brother, Henri had, just before the Texas expedition, married a niece and one of the heiresses of Stephen Girard, rich merchant of Philadelphia, which explains why he was not of the Texas company. Rigaud remained in New Orleans and died there in 1820, not knowing that he, too, shared in Napoleon’s will to the extent of one hundred thousand francs.</p>
