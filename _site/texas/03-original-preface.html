    <h2 id="the-heroine-of-texas"><em>The Heroine of Texas</em></h2>
<p>by M. G…n F……n, 1819</p>

<p><em>L’Heroïne du Texas</em>, ou voyage de Madame *** aux États-Unis et au Mexique</p>

<h3 id="editors-preface">Editor’s Preface</h3>
<p>This work, whatever be the judgment which may be formed of it, is not a <em>novel</em>. The facts set down here are true, except that <em>Ernestine</em> and <em>Edmund</em> are not the names of my hero and heroine; I have thought it best to change them.</p>

<p>If there are persons who charge that I have made use of information already set down by others, I shall answer them as follows: Texas has become a rich field and anyone may exploit it. The newspapers have published various letters recounting events which transpired there: each colonist or refugee may on his return to France have his story of it printed, without anyone having the right to accuse him of plagiarism. The facts will be the same; the editing alone will offer variations. I have obtained details in this way, and I have used them; I have enlarged or modified them according to my taste, and I have turned them to account in the most advantageous way for the success of the work which I offer to the public.</p>

<p>M. Ladvocat brought out, sometime ago, a work on Texas. In it, he gave, on pages 25 and following, some information on the geographical situation of this province.</p>

<p>Messrs. Hartmann and Millard, members of the Champ d’Asile colony, but lately returned to France, have just published an historical treatise on that which they took part in or observed. I have looked through these two works: many of the details are the same; the style alone is different, and the resemblance between the two accounts is much more striking on page 122 <em>et seq.</em> where these gentlemen speak of the soil and the products —in a word, of everything which shows the resemblance between this country and Mexico.</p>

<p>M. Ladvocat, who had the advantage of priority, could then assail them. They could answer: we were on the ground; he could reply: I published my work before yours and etc., a series of interminable discussions. On all sides one would hear repeated with more or less vigor: <em>I have pillaged, thou hast pillaged, he has pillaged.</em> Well! Gentlemen! A fourth, more reasonable and cooler, would say to them, <em>We have all stolen:</em> let us sell, believe me, in peace, our more or less true stories about Texas. That is what should concern us. The essential point is to have a big sale and to secure the honor of a second edition.</p>

<p>As to the claims which historians of Texas—present or to be—could make, they will be answered as simply as naturally:</p>

<p><em>“Everyone at this business<br />
Can fruitlessly waste ink and paper.”<br /></em></p>

<p>I come back to the question in hand. It shall perhaps be urged against me that I have enlarged too much on the loves of Edmund and Ernestine; I answer that these developments seemed necessary to me, and that having omitted nothing of all that happened in Texas from the arrival of the French refugees in Champ d’Asile to their departure, I thought that the first duty of an historian was to portray in all their beauty and heroism the graces, glory and virtue of the exiles, and that this was the surest means of commending myself, as well as my work, to the indulgence of the readers.</p>
