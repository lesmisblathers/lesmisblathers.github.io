### 2.6.8: Post Corda Lapides

**Post Corda Lapides**: Latin: Literally, ‘After the hearts, the stones.’

**the eleven thousand devils’ playground:** In his book *William Shakespeare*, Hugo refers (bk 1, ch. 3) to a drinking establishment, founded by the Vicomte de Montauban, called ‘le Tripot des onze mille diables’. A gang of bandits who ravaged the Limousin and Auvergne area in the mid sixteenth century were known as the ‘eleven thousand devils’. (A leader of the gang, Jean de Cathalando, repented of his misdeeds and became a Franciscan friar at the monastery of Sellières.)

**Rue Droit-Mur ... Rue des Églantiers**: *Droit-Mur* means ‘straight wall’. *Églantier* is the sweet briar, or wild rose.
