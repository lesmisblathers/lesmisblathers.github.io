No footnotes

#### Rose/Madden: Petite Rue Picpus, No. 62
No footnotes

### 2.6.2: The Obedience of Martin Verga

#### Donougher: The Observance of Martin Verga

##### Martin Verga:
An allusion to Dom Martin de Vargas (died 1446), founder in 1425 of the Cisterian Congregation of Castile, at Monte Sion, near Toledo in Spain, with the intention of returning to a more strict observance of the Benedictine Rule.

##### Clairvaux … Cîteaux … St Bernard … St Benedict:
St Benedict of Nursia (c.480–c.547) is generally recognized as the founder of Western monasticism, and his Rule is a detailed guide to how the religious life should be observed and regulated. He himself founded a number of monasteries, including the one at Monte Cassino, where he died. In 1098 St Robert (c.1028–1111), abbot de Molesme, founded a monastery at Cîteaux near Dijon, where it was intended the Rule of St Benedict would be rigorously observed. This community became known as members of the Cistercian Order, and was joined in 1112 by St Bernard (1090–1153), who in 1115 was sent forth by the abbot to found a new house. Bernard founded the monastery at Clairvaux with which he is identified and where the monastic tradition was reformed and revived.

##### had he become a hermit?:
There is a French proverb: ‘Quand le diable devient vieux, il se fait ermite’ (‘When the devil grows old, he becomes a hermit’). In other words, a misspent youth is often followed by a pious old age.

##### Subiaco … temple of Apollo:
St Gregory the Great (c.540–604; from 590 Pope Gregory I) tells us in his account of St Benedict’s life (*Dialogues*, bk 2) that as an aspiring servant of God, Benedict fled from his home (more likely at about the age of nineteen or twenty) to ‘a desert place called Subiaco, almost forty miles distant from Rome’, where he lived as a hermit, devoting himself to prayer and to overcoming the temptations of the flesh. After a number of years, probably in about 529, he went to Monte Cassino, about eighty miles south of Rome, and there on the site of a temple to Apollo founded the monastery for which he wrote the Benedictine Rule.

##### the Oratory … Filippo de’ Neri … Pierre de Bérulle:
Founded by the Italian Filippo de’ Neri (1515–95), the Congregation of the Oratory received papal recognition in 1575. It is an institution consisting of autonomous communities of priests bound not by monastic vows but by those of the priesthood only, and devoted to prayer and preaching and the celebration of the sacraments. Filippo de’ Neri refused a cardinalship (offered by Gregory XIV) and was canonized in 1622. In 1611 Cardinal Pierre de Bérulle (1575–1629) founded a new Congregation in France, recognized by a papal bull in 1613, and differing from the Italian institution mostly in that the houses came under the overall authority of a superior-general and a general assembly. The Oratory was founded in England in 1847 by John Henry Newman (1801–90), cardinal from 1879.

##### stability:
The Benedictine vow of stability (*stabilitas loci*) binds the new member of the order to the particular monastery or convent in which the vows are made, thereby securing the stable communities that St Benedict sought to establish.

##### lay sisters:
In some Catholic orders a distinction is made between lay sisters and choir sisters. The lay sisters, who generally perform household duties, may be bound by the same vows and as strictly enclosed as the choir sisters, but although they may attend the offices they do not sing.

#### Rose/Madden: The Rule of Martin Verga

##### Martin Verga:
Hugo created an imaginary religious order based on the name of a fifteenth-century Spanish Cistercian, Martin de Vargas, who instigated reforms within the order but did not found a new rule.

##### Bernardines:
i.e., Cistercians, among the strictest of monastic orders. As Hugo explains, the monastery of Cîteaux, and thus the Cistercian order, was founded in 1098 by Saint Robert de Molesme, who wanted to reestablish strict obedience to the monastic rules laid down by Saint Benedict (ca. 480–ca. 547), the founder of the Western tradition of monasticism. Robert was eclipsed by the prestige of his successor as abbot of Cîteaux, Saint Bernard (1090–1138), who founded a number of filial abbeys, most notably Clairvaux. As Hugo indicates, a number of medieval religious orders were founded as an attempt to return to the original rule of Saint Benedict.

##### he was old and … hermit:
Hugo seems to be playing on the old French proverb “When the devil gets old, he’ll become a monk.” One of the abbeys Saint Benedict founded is the famous abbey of Monte Cassino, previously the site of a pagan temple dedicated to Apollo.

##### Ladies of the Blessed Sacrament:
This was a real convent in the rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève, on the left bank, that Hugo had originally thought to use as Jean Valjean’s retreat before deciding to invent a convent, and even a fictional order, in order to avoid offending any real religious communities.

##### Philip di Neri … Pierre de Bérulle:
Philip di Neri (1515–95) was founder of the order of the Oratory in Italy. Pierre de Bérulle (1575–1629) founded the French Oratory.

### 2.6.3: Austerities

#### Donougher: Austerities

No footnotes

#### Rose/Madden: The Austerities

##### mademoiselles de Sainte-Aulaire and de Bélissen:
Sainte-Aulaire and de Bélissen were the names of well-known families of the French aristocracy, as were the Choiseuls and the Sérents, mentioned later.

##### Talbot:
the family name of the earls of Shrewsbury, several of whom remained in the Catholic Church after the Reformation.

### 2.6.4: Gayeties

#### Donougher: Gladness

##### Perrault … Hecuba … Little Red Riding Hood’s grandmother:
Elected to the French Academy in 1671, Charles Perrault (1628–1703) in 1697 published *Contes de Ma Mère l’Oye* (Tales of Mother Goose), which included ‘Le Petit Chaperon Rouge’ (‘Little Red Riding Hood’). Hecuba was the wife of Priam of Troy, the city destroyed by the Greeks in the Trojan War, of which Homer’s *Iliad* gives an account. Among her nineteen children were Paris, Hector and Cassandra.

##### Agathocles:
The ancient Greek name as in, for instance, Agathocles of Syracuse, in French is Agathoclès, pronounced Agathe-aux-clés, meaning ‘Agatha with the keys’.

##### four nations … Collège Mazarin:
See note p. 1345 on the Institut the ‘Quatre-Nations’ … the Opéra-Comique the ‘Feydeau’.

> **the Institut the ‘Quatre-Nations’ … the Opéra-Comique the ‘Feydeau’:** The French statesman Cardinal Mazarin, Louis XIV’s chief minister from 1642 until his death in 1661, left provisions in his will for the founding of a college for students from France’s newly acquired territories, to be known as the Collège des Quatre-Nations (College of Four Nations) or the Collège Mazarin. Suppressed during the Revolution, it became in 1801 the Palais des Beaux-Arts, and in 1805 the home of the Institut de France. The Théâtre Feydeau merged in 1801 with the Opéra-Comique, which then moved to the Salle Feydeau, where it continued to stage performances as the Opéra-Comique until 1829.

##### Écouen:
In 1805 Napoleon signed a decree providing for the creation of three schools for the daughters (often orphaned) of holders of the Legion of Honour. The first to open, in 1807, was housed in the Château d’Écouen, dating from the sixteenth century, some fifteen miles north of Paris. The school foundation exists to this day, but has not been located at Écouen since 1962. The Château d’Écouen now houses the Musée National de la Renaissance.

#### Rose/Madden: Fun

##### There … in prison:
“Il est arrivé un coup de bâton. / C’est Polichinelle qui l’a donné au chat. / Ça ne lui a pas fait de bien, ça lui a fait du mal. / Alors une dame a mis Polichinelle en prison.”

### 2.6.5: Distractions

#### Donougher: Diversions

##### White Paternoster:
Almost a magic charm rather than a prayer, the White Paternoster is part of medieval folklore, referred to in Chaucer’s *Miller’s Tale* (line 3485), for instance. (The English prayer rhyme ‘Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, / Bless the bed that I lie on’ is sometimes called the Black Paternoster.)

##### St Margaret’s cross:
St Margaret of Antioch is associated with a number of miraculous incidents, including being swallowed by Satan in the form of a dragon, from which she escaped alive, protected by the cross that she was wearing.

##### Nemo regulas … communicabit.:
‘No one shall divulge our rule or regulations to any outsiders.’

##### Monsieur de Quélen:
Louis de Quélen (1778–1839), archbishop of Paris from 1821, member of the French Academy from 1824.

##### Monsieur le Duc de Rohan:
Auguste de Rohan (1788–1833) in 1815 was widowed when his young wife Armandine de Sérent (1789–1815) died in a tragic accident after her dress caught fire. He then became a priest, was named archbishop of Besançon, and in 1830 was made a cardinal.

##### the king’s musketeers:
A creation of Louis XIII, this royal cavalry guard, having been revived in 1814, was finally suppressed in 1816.

##### Magnates mulieres:
The formula is taken from ‘an ordinance issued in 1245 by Eudes [Odo] de Châteauroux … canon and chancellor of Notre-Dame’ (he was also papal legate to France in 1245), prohibiting outsiders – including the mothers and sisters of the nuns – from staying overnight within the cloister of Notre-Dame, unless they are great ladies *quae sine scandolo evitari non possint*’, and cited in *The History of Paris from the Earliest Period to the Present Day*, London: Whitaker and Galignani, 1825, vol. 1, p. 32.<br/>
Citing an ordinance of 1207 by ‘the legate Odo’, Hugo uses this formula in fuller detail in The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (bk IV, ch. 5): ‘aliquae magnates mulieres, quae sine scandolo evitari non possunt’ (some great ladies who cannot be refused without scandal).

##### My Zétulbé:
A song from the popular French comic opera *Le Calife de Bagdad* (first performed in 1800) by François-Adrien Boieldieu (1775–1834) with a libretto by Claude de Saint-Just. In 1817 it was staged in Paris in an Italian version, *Il Califfo di Bagdad*, translated by Andrea Leone Tottola and with a new score by Manuel Garcia (1775–1832). Zétulbé is the young woman of Baghdad wooed by the caliph in disguise.

#### Rose/Madden: Entertainment

##### the Lives of the Saints:
Several books were devoted to the stories of Catholic saints. Hugo may refer here to Dom Mabillon’s *Lives of the Benedictine Saints* (see here) or to the *Lives of the Saints of the Order of Saint Benedict* by Marguerite de Blemeur (see here), supposed ancestress of Mother Innocent.

 > **“Dom Mabillon” … “Me neither”:** Dom Mabillon (1623–1707), a Benedictine monk and scholar, author of *The Lives of the Benedictine Saints*. We will not follow Mother Innocent through all twists and turns of her erudition, which, though Hugo gently mocks it, was his own as well. Yves Gohin attributes this scene to Hugo’s love of reading dictionaries, in this case Louis Moreri’s *Catholic Encyclopaedia*, first published in 1649. Several of the authorities and examples Mother Innocent cites are erroneous or simply inventions of Hugo’s. Old man Fauchelevent’s uncomprehending goodwill (“Me neither”) toward Merlonus Horstius confirms Hugo’s lighthearted touch in this scene, in which one can see the hand of Hugo the playwright.

> **Marguerite de Blemeur:** a seventeenth-century (1618–96) nun and scholar who wrote the *Lives of the Saints of the Order of Saint Benedict*.

##### Nemo regulas … communicabit:
“No one shall discuss our rules or our institution with outsiders.”

##### Montmorencys:
The Montmorencys claimed direct descent from one of Charlemagne’s barons.

##### Monseigneur de Quélen:
Louis-Hyancinthe de Quélen (1778–1839), archbishop of Paris from 1821 until his death.

##### Monsieur le duc de Rohan:
Louis-François-Auguste de Rohan-Chabot (1788–1833), known as the prince de Léon before succeeding his father as duc de Rohan; one of the most elegant young men of the *grand monde*, he shocked his family and friends by entering the priesthood after the death of his young wife in 1815. He was named archbishop of Auch in 1828 and later cardinal archbishop of Besançon. He was the model for the elegant bishop of Agde in Stendhal’s *The Red and the Black*. Hugo knew the ducal archbishop in the 1820s.

### 2.6.6: The Little Convent

#### Donougher: The Little Convent

##### The pupils called her Madame Vacarmini:
A character in La Musicomanie (Music Mania), an anonymous one-act comedy first staged in 1779, Vacarmini is an Italian whose name, constructed from the noun vacarme, meaning ‘din’, ‘uproar’, to which an italianizing ending has been added, is intended to present him in a ludicrous light.

##### Madame de Genlis … L’Intrépide:
Félicité du Crest de St-Aubin, Comtesse de Genlis (1746–1830), was entrusted by the Duc de Chartres (from 1785, Duc d’Orléans), whose mistress she was, with the education of his children. The eldest was Louis-Philippe, who inherited the title Duc d’Orléans when his father was guillotined in 1793 and was king of France from 1830 to 1848. Madame de Genlis also made a name for herself as a prolific writer. She wrote historical and pedagogical novels (one of which, *Adelaide and Theodore* in the English translation, is mentioned in Jane Austen’s Emma, 1816), and received an honorary degree from Oxford University. The journal *L’Intrépide*, in which her intention, as she says in her memoirs, was to correct grammar mistakes made in the daily newspapers, did not survive beyond the first issue in 1820.

##### Imparibus meritis … tua perdas:
‘Three bodies of unequal merit hang from the branches: / Dismas and Gesmas and the divinity between them. / Dismas seeks the highest, wretched Gesmas the lowest. / May the Almighty protect us and our belongings. / Recite this verse that you might not lose your belongings by theft.’ In an apocryphal text the two thieves crucified with Christ are named as Dismas and Gesmas, Dismas being the unnamed penitent thief in Luke 23:39–43.

##### Vicomte de Gestas:
Gestas is the name of a noble family dating back to the beginning of the eleventh century, but they have not held the title of vicomte.

#### Rose/Madden: The Little Convent

##### the Ladies of Sainte-Aure:
The small community of Sainte-Aure occupied a house next to the Benedictine convent Hugo based Petit-Picpus on; it was destroyed and disbanded during the Revolution.

##### Madame de Beaufort d’Hautpoul and Madame la marquise Dufresne:
Again Hugo has used real names in his invented convent.

##### Madame de Genlis:
As a shocking and ostentatious gesture of modernity, the duc d’Orléans, later known as Philippe-Égalité, hired the comtesse de Genlis (1746–1830), who was also his mistress, as tutor for his children, including the future King Louis-Philippe, in the 1780s. During the Revolution, she emigrated to England, where she supported herself by writing novels. She entered her “ferociously devout phase” on returning to France in 1800. Napoléon gave her a pension and, it was widely believed, employed her as a spy among her circle of friends.

##### Imparibus meritis … tua perdas:
“Three bodies of unequal merit hang from the branches; / Dismas and Gesmas and the power of the divine; / Dismas wishes to go on high; unhappy Gesmas will go below; / Let our bodies and our goods be protected by the Supreme Power. / Recite these verses so that theft shall not deprive you of what is yours.”

##### Dismas and Gestas:
According to extracanonical tradition, Dismas and Gestas were the two thieves crucified along with Jesus on the hill at Golgotha. Gestas, on Jesus’s left, mocked the Son of God for not saving his own life. Dismas asked Christ for mercy and went to heaven.

##### the vicomte de Gestas:
It would seem an odd thing to brag about, but such claims were not unheard of. An eighteenth-century duc de Lévis claimed that his family descended from the biblical Levi.

##### the Hospitaller order:
Several orders of nuns were described as *hospitalières*, that is, dedicated to the care of the sick.

### 2.6.7: Some Silhouettes of This Darkness

#### Donougher: Some Figures in the Gloom

##### Marguerite de Blemeur:
The Benedictine nun Jacqueline Bouette de Blemur (1618–96) is the author of *L’année bénédictine, ou les vies des saints de l’ordre de S. Benoît* (The Benedictine Year, or the Lives of the Saints of the Order of St Benedict), 1667–73.

##### Madame Dacier:
Anne Dacier (1654–1720) was a noted scholar and translator of the classics, including Homer’s *Iliad* (1699) and *Odyssey* (1708).

##### Ceracchi:
Giuseppe Ceracchi (1751–1801) was an Italian neoclassical sculptor who lived and worked in England, America, Holland, Prussia and Austria, before finally moving to Paris. He was guillotined in 1801 after becoming embroiled in a conspiracy against Napoleon.

##### Gauvain … Drouet … Cogolludo … d’Auverney … Cifuentes … La Miltière … Laudinière … Sigüenza … Suzon:
Hugo has used in this paragraph names connected with his own life: Julienne Gauvain, better known as Juliette Drouet (1806–83), was his mistress and devoted companion from 1833 until her death. During the Peninsular War, Hugo’s father was made general and governor of the central provinces of Spain and given the title count by the then king of Spain Joseph Bonaparte. Cogolludo, Cifuentes and Sigüenza are all towns located in the Spanish central province of Guadalajar, which came under General Hugo’s governorship. Hugo’s maternal grandfather was born at Auvergné near Nantes; Hugo wrote some of his early articles under the name d’Auverney, and gave the name Auverney to one of the main characters in his first novel, *Bug-Jargal*, written when he was sixteen. La Miltière is the country estate of which l’Audinière was a smaller part, bought by General Hugo and his second wife in 1823, and is where Victor Hugo’s first child, Léopold, who died aged three months, was buried. ‘Suzette et Suzon’ is a poem by Hugo, published posthumously in the collection *Toute la Lyre* (1888 and 1893) and set to music by Saint-Saëns.

##### Île Bourbon:
Claimed as French territory in 1642, this island in the Indian Ocean, named Île Bourbon in 1649, was renamed Île de la Réunion in 1793, retaining that name since 1848.

##### Chevalier Roze:
The nobleman Nicolas Roze (1675–1733) distinguished himself during the epidemic of plague in Marseille in 1720 by his devoted and selfless service, particularly in organizing the burial of the dead. He himself contracted the disease, but survived.

#####‘What a devil of a noise!’:
In the French text, ‘C’est le diable à quatre’. With Madame de Genlis’s signature four rings in mind, Hugo here is playing on the expression *faire le diable à quatre,* meaning ‘to create a great deal of noise and disorder’ and said to derive from medieval morality plays featuring four characters – the devil and his lieutenants.

#### Rose/Madden: A Few Silhouettes in the Shadows

##### Marguerite de Blemeur:
a seventeenth-century (1618–96) nun and scholar who wrote the Lives of the Saints of the Order of Saint Benedict.

##### the Dacier of the Order:
its scholar, Anne Dacier (1647–1720), was an accomplished woman of letters who translated classical authors from Sappho and Aristophanes to Plautus and Terence.

##### Mademoiselle Gauvain … Mademoiselle de Siguenza:
Several of the names Hugo gives here have resonance in his own life. Gauvain, for example, was the real family name of his longtime mistress, Juliette Drouet. Cogolludo, Cifuentes, and Siguenza were fiefs granted to Hugo’s father by Joseph Bonaparte in Spain; Miltière and Laudinière were properties purchased by General Hugo under the Restoration; Auverné near Nantes was the birthplace of Hugo’s mother, Sophie Trébuchet.

##### the Isle of Bourbon … Roze:
Réunion, in the Indian Ocean, now an overseas department (Département d’Outre-Mer, DOM) of France. The chevalier Roze was Nicolas Roger Roze (1675–1733), who worked heroically to alleviate the conditions in Marseilles during the plague of 1720.

### 2.6.8: Post Corda Lapides

#### Donougher: Post Corda Lapides

##### Post Corda Lapides:
Latin: Literally, ‘After the hearts, the stones.’

##### the eleven thousand devils’ playground:
In his book *William Shakespeare*, Hugo refers (bk 1, ch. 3) to a drinking establishment, founded by the Vicomte de Montauban, called ‘le Tripot des onze mille diables’. A gang of bandits who ravaged the Limousin and Auvergne area in the mid sixteenth century were known as the ‘eleven thousand devils’. (A leader of the gang, Jean de Cathalando, repented of his misdeeds and became a Franciscan friar at the monastery of Sellières.)

##### Rue Droit-Mur ... Rue des Églantiers:
*Droit-Mur* means ‘straight wall’. *Églantier* is the sweet briar, or wild rose.

#### Rose/Madden: Post Corda Lapides

##### Post corda lapides:
“After the hearts, the stones.”

##### _a jeu de paume_ … “eleven thousand devils”:
The *jeu de paume* (predecessor of the tennis court) was another landmark on the left bank near the convent of the rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève.

### 2.6.9: A Century Under a Guimpe

#### Donougher: A Century under the Veil

##### Fontevrault:
The huge medieval abbey complex at Fontevrault in Anjou, once housing four communities – of monks, repentant fallen women, lepers and nuns, ruled by the aristocratic women who predominated within the order – was the burial place of the Plantagenet kings Henry II (1133–89) and his sons Richard the Lionheart (1157–99) and John (1167–1216), and also of Henry’s wife Eleanor of Aquitaine (1124–1204).

##### Monsieur de Miromesnil:
Armand Thomas Hue (1723–96), Marquis de Miromesnil, Louis XVI’s minister of justice (1774–87).

##### and now, mon père, it’s my turn to take advantage of you:
The nun’s quaintness of expression, using the verb *bailler*, ‘to give’ or ‘to pledge’, which has a chivalric resonance, becomes comic when she inadvertently uses the verb in a turn of phrase that has a decidedly colloquial ring to it, suggesting deception.

##### the distinction of inspiring Molière:
In Molière’s play of 1669, *Monsieur de Pourceaugnac*, the hapless provincial nobleman of the title, who has come to Paris to claim an unwilling bride, is the victim of a comic conspiracy to thwart him, and he ends up at the end of Act I being pursued by an apothecary, doctors and dancing swordsmen, all brandishing syringes.

#### Rose/Madden: A Century Under a Wimple

##### the abbey of Fontevrault:
sometimes Fontevraud, an unusual abbey that was both a monastery and a nunnery. The Plantagenets supported the abbey, and several members of the family—Henry II, Eleanor of Aquitaine, and Richard the Lion-Hearted—are buried there. It was turned into a prison in 1804.

##### Monsieur de Miromesnil:
Armand-Thomas Hue de Miromesnil (1723–96), keeper of the seals for most of the reign of Louis XVI (1774–87).

##### the Bernardines were right up there with the Musketeers:
a reference to the great age of libertinage in the eighteenth century; the implication is that Bernardine monks of aristocratic origin were as elegant and worldly as young officers of the musketeers. While the *abbé mondain* is a common literary and historical figure of the Enlightenment, it is unusual to see monks described in this way.

##### giving Molière an idea:
It is not clear what play Hugo might be referring to, but farces about lovers’ misunderstandings are not unusual in Molière’s work.

### 2.6.10: Origin of the Perpetual Adoration

#### Donougher: The Origin of Perpetual Adoration

No footnotes

#### Rose/Madden: Origins of Perpetual Adoration

##### In 1649, the Blessed Sacrament … with this pious aim:
Hugo seems to have invented the incident involving the desecration of the Eucharist, but he has once again used real people in his fictional creation. Catherine de Bar (1614–98), known as Mother Mechthilde du Saint-Sacrement, was a well known, influential abbess in the seventeenth century. She did in fact found a convent dedicated to the adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, in the rue du Bac, in 1653. The comtesse de Châteauvieux was a friend and supporter of Mother Mechthilde.

### 2.6.11: End of the Petit-Picpus

#### Donougher: The End of the Petit-Picpus

##### Volaverunt:
‘They have flown.’

##### Julia Alpinula:
According to legend, Julia Alpinula was a priestess serving the goddess Aventia in Helvetia when the Roman emperor Galba died in AD 69. Loyal to Galba, her father refused to recognize his successor Vitellius, and when defeated by one of Vitellius’ ruthless generals, Aulus Caecina, he was executed despite his daughter’s pleas for mercy. She too was executed. Byron alludes to her story in *Childe Harold* (canto 3, stanza 66) and in a footnote gives a fuller version of the epitaph: *Julia Alpinula / Hic jaceo / Infelicis patris infelix proles / Deae Aventiae Sacerdos / Exorare patris necem non potui / Male mori in fatis illi erat / Vixi annos XXIII* (‘Julia Alpinula / here I lie / unhappy child of an unhappy father / priestess of the goddess Aventia / I could not avert my father’s death by entreaty / he was doomed to die by violence / I lived twenty-three years.’) Byron comments: ‘I know of no human composition so affecting as this; nor a history of deeper interest: these are names and actions which ought not to perish …’ Even in 1846 the epitaph was considered a forgery and there is no evidence that Julia Alpinula ever existed.

##### Hic jaceo. Vixi annos viginti et tres:
‘Here I lie. I lived twenty-three years.’

##### Hortus conclusus:
The enclosed garden is a visual theme of devotional art identified with Mary the Mother of God, emerging in the fifteenth century and evoking her perpetual virginity. Its literary origins go back to the Song of Songs 4:12: ‘A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.’

##### Voltaire … to mock the crucifix:
Voltaire was famously outraged by the barbaric torture and execution of a young nobleman, the Chevalier de la Barre, accused of mutilating a crucifix at Abbeville in 1765, a crime which was not proven and which should not in any case have warranted the death penalty. In his *Account of the Death of the Chevalier de la Barre* (1766) he protested against the exposure of crucifixes and religious images on public highways, rather than in the churches where in his view they more properly belonged. In 1761, Voltaire had taken up the case of the Huguenot merchant Jean Calas of Toulouse, who was found guilty of murdering his son in order to prevent or punish his conversion to Catholicism, for which Calas was tortured and executed. As a result of Voltaire’s involvement in the campaign to clear his name, the case was reviewed. The conviction was overturned and the family was paid compensation. In his *Treatise on Tolerance* (1763; ch. 23) Voltaire addresses a prayer to an all-embracing God: ‘que les petites différences entre les vêtements qui couvrent nos débiles corps, entre tous nos langages insuffisants, entre tous nos usages ridicules, entre toutes nos lois imparfaites, entre toutes nos opinions insensées, entre toutes nos conditions si disproportionnées à nos yeux, et si égales devant toi; que toutes ces petites nuances qui distinguent les atomes appelés *hommes* ne soient pas des signaux de haine et de persécution’ (‘that the slight differences in the garments that cover our frail bodies, in our insufficient languages, in our ridiculous customs, in our imperfect laws, in our unreasonable opinions, in all our conditions, so incomparable in our eyes and so equal before you; that all these small distinctions that differentiate the atoms called men be not signals for hatred and persecution’).

##### Voltaire … Sirven:
In 1762 a Huguenot couple named Sirven, accused of murdering their daughter because she wanted to become a Catholic, escaped to Switzerland to avoid arrest. They were sentenced to death in absentia, and all their assets confiscated. Voltaire took up their cause, and eventually their conviction was overthrown.

#### Rose/Madden: End of the Petit-Picpus

##### Volaverunt:
“They have flown away.”

##### Julia Alpinula:
the inscription of a tombstone found in a Roman excavation in Switzerland: “Here I lie, I lived for twenty-three years.”

##### Joseph de Maistre … Voltaire:
Joseph de Maistre (see here) was as devoted to orthodox Catholicism as he was to absolute monarchy; Voltaire’s hostility to the Catholic Church was legendary.

> **Maistre … Beccaria:** The conservative count Joseph de Maistre (1753–1821) was one of the leading politcal theorists of legitimacy and conservatism in post-Napoleonic France; Marquis Cesare di Beccaria (1738–94) was an Italian philosopher and politician whose treatise *On Crime and Punishment* (1764) advocated penal reform and the abolition of torture and the death penalty.

##### Calas:
*The affaire Calas* was a criminal trial in which a Protestant, Jean Calas, was convicted of the murder of his son in spite of inconclusive evidence. In Toulouse, where relations between Catholics and Protestants remained hostile well into the nineteenth century, Calas was suspected of having wanted to stop his son from converting to Catholicism. Calas was executed in 1762, but Voltaire was able to have his conviction posthumously overturned three years later.

## Book 7: Parenthesis

### 2.7.1: The Convent As an Abstract Idea

#### Donougher: The Convent as Abstract Idea

No footnotes

#### Rose/Madden: The Convent as an Abstract Idea

##### A Parenthesis:
Yves Gohin notes that Hugo’s Belgian publisher, Lacroix, asked him to delete this section from the novel, which was growing to an alarming length. Hugo at first agreed, then protested, “I cannot introduce a convent into *Les Misérables* only to praise it. There must be some reservations.”

##### the infinite:
The idea of the infinite, *l’infini*—the limitless nature of the sky, the ocean, God, love, hate, the natural world—fascinated the Romantics.

##### a hideous side … and a sublime side:
an apparent allusion to Hugo’s theory of the *grotesque*, his fascination with the duality of *laideur* (ugliness) and *beauté* in a single person, feeling, or entity. Hugo elaborated on his idea of the *grotesque* in the preface to his play *Cromwell*; the play is in fact remembered because of the preface. The best-known example is probably Quasimodo of *Notre-Dame de Paris*, whose hideous physical appearance hides the sublime and infinite love he bears for Esmeralda. see [2.7.2], where the image of the bleeding Christ is described as “hideous and magnificent.”

### 2.7.2: The Convent As an Historical Fact

#### Donougher: The Convent as Historical Fact

##### kizlar-agha:
Turkish: Literally, ‘lord of the girls’, the chief black eunuch of the Ottoman sultan’s harem.

##### in pace:
The Latin ‘in peace’, used to refer to a monastic prison cell.

##### that poor Holofernes:
As related in the Book of Judith, Holofernes was the Assyrian general who laid siege to the Jewish city of Bethulia and was beheaded in his sleep by a woman called Judith; it was a popular theme of the Renaissance and Baroque periods, treated by Michelangelo (in the Sistine Chapel) and Caravaggio, among many others.

#### Rose/Madden: The Convent as Historical Fact

##### what mistletoe is to oak:
Mistletoe is a parasite on oak.

##### seraphim:
the highest order of angels, who live in the presence of God.

##### a whiff of the East:
French and European writers of the Romantic era, indeed the entire nineteenth century, were fascinated by the “Orient.” The references in this paragraph to the aga khan of heaven, the seraglio (the harem), the odalisque, and the eunuch are all manifestations of this exotic imagining of the East.

##### aga khan of heaven:
The aga khan was the ruler of the Ismalian sect of Muslims; here the reference is more vaguely meant to indicate a Muslim equivalent of an archbishop.

##### seraglio:
In the harem, or seraglio, the odalisques (concubines) of the sultan were guarded by eunuchs.

##### The *in pace* replaced the leather bag:
The *in pace* is a cell used as a means of discipline in convents. The “leather bag” refers to the legendary means of execution favoured by Ottoman sultans, in this case for adulterous wives or insolent concubines: The victim was sewn into a leather bag and thrown, alive, into the waters of the Bosporus.

##### Jean-Jacques:
Rousseau’s last name was not necessary, especially for those who saw him as a virtual prophet, as did many Romantics.

##### Diderot:
Denis Diderot (see here), with Voltaire and Rousseau, is considered the greatest of the *philosophes* He is best known for directing and editing the *Encyclopédie* and writing novels such as *Jacques the Fatalist and His Master*, *Rameau’s Nephew*, and the scandalous, posthumously published *The Nun*.

> Denis Diderot (1713–84), along with Voltaire and Rousseau one of the greatest figures of the French Enlightenment. An archrationalist and atheist, Diderot was best known in his time as the co-editor (with d’Alembert) of the *Encyclopédie*, the great compendium of Enlightenment rationalism; he was also an essayist, playwright, and novelist. The senator’s opinions on Diderot reveal him to be a man of dangerously little knowledge.

##### Voltaire on Calas, Labarre, and Sirven:
As in the [*affaire Calas*](#calas), Jacques de Labarre and the Protestant Sirvens were convicted of crimes before Voltaire took up their cause. At the age of sixteen, the chevalier de Labarre (1746–66) was accused of blasphemy for the desecration of a statue of the Virgin Mary. He was condemned to have his hand cut off and his tongue cut out before being burned at the stake; on appeal the sentence was reduced to simple decapitation. Voltaire (among others) fought in vain to stop his execution, which was the last for a charge of blasphemy under the ancien régime. The Sirvens, husband and wife, were accused of murdering their daughter in order to prevent her from converting to Catholicism. In this case, the couple fled to Switzerland before being arrested and were condemned to death in absentia. Voltaire succeeded in his efforts to have their sentence overturned.

##### Tacitus, too … “that poor Holofernes”:
The works of the Roman senator and historian Tacitus (ca. 56–117) chronicled the lives of five Caesars, including Nero. In the book of Judith, in the Catholic Old Testament (excluded by the Protestant and Jewish canons), Holofernes was the Assyrian general sent by Nebuchadnezzar to subdue the rebellious Jerusalem. As his armies starved the city by siege, the beautiful and pious widow Judith made her way to his tent, seduced him, and gave him wine until he fell asleep, at which point she cut off his head, which she carried back to Jerusalem in triumph. The story of Judith and Holofernes inspired painters from Rembrandt to Klimt and several operas.

##### *oubliettes*:
these cells evocatively derive their name from the French verb *oublier*, “to forget.”

### 2.7.3: On What Conditions One Can Respect the Past

#### Donougher: On What Conditions We Can Respect the Past

##### a black heifer:
‘White animals were offered to heavenly deities, black to those of the underworld … So at Rome, where the importance and difficulty of getting a white victim for Jupiter led to whitening with pipe clay (Juvenal, Satire 10, line 65, *cretatum bovem*)’, *A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities*, ed. W. Smith, W. Wayte and G. E. Marindin, London: J. Murray, 1890.

##### *Bos cretatus*:
Latin: ‘Chalk-whitened ox’, for sacrificial purposes.

#### Rose/Madden: On What Conditions We can Respect The Past

##### put the handles back on the aspersoria and the sabres:
Aspersoria are vessels made to carry holy water. Paired with sabres, the image suggests forced conversions to Christianity in early medieval Europe.

##### Haruspices:
Haruspices were Etruscan, and later Roman, priests who specialized in reading the entrails of sacrificed animals.

##### *Bos cretatus*:
a reference to the satires of Juvenal, in which the author mocks the superficial religious practices of his contemporaries. If a white bull was required for sacrifice but unavailable, a bull of some other colour was simply whitened with chalk.

##### the city of 1789, of 1830, of 1848:
the French revolutions that toppled, respectively, Louis XVI and the ancien régime, Charles X and the Charter of 1815, and finally Louis-Philippe and the July Monarchy.

##### fakirs, bonzes … talapoins, and dervishes:
Muslim, Hindu, and Eastern Orthodox clerics are lumped together in a scornful comparison to those living in Catholic cloisters.

Aristotle’s school in Athens. The French word lycée, secondary school, is derived from “lyceum.”

### 2.7.7: Precautions to Be Observed in Blame

#### Donougher: Take Care in Censuring

##### Caiaphas … Draco … Trimalchio … Tiberius:
Caiaphas was the Jewish high priest who presided over the court that sought evidence against Christ in order to put him to death (Matthew 26:57–68). He appears in medieval passion plays dressed as a bishop. Draco, the Athenian legislator of the seventh century BC, established a legal code that was considered particularly harsh, with the death penalty prescribed for even minor offences – hence the term ‘draconian’. A debauched parvenu of immense wealth and no morals, Trimalchio is a character in the satirical novel *Satyricon* by the first-century-AD Latin author Petronius. The Roman emperor Tiberius (42 BC–AD 37) is portrayed by the historian Tacitus (56–117) as crafty, cruel, licentious and unprincipled.

#### Rose/Madden: Precautions to Take in Laying Blame

##### Caiaphas as bishop … Tiberius as emperor:
Caiaphus was the high priest of Jerusalem at the time of Christ’s trial; he continued to persecute early Christians after the Crucifixion. Draco, the Athenian ruler (seventh century B.C.E.), is remembered as the creator of unreasonably harsh laws. The adjective draconian derives from his name. Trimalcion was from the *Satyricon* of the first-century Roman author Petronius; Trimalcion, or Trimalchio, is a pompous nouveau riche Roman who flaunts his wealth and his shallow understanding of literature and philosophy. Trimalcion as “lawmaker” or legislator recalls the senator of Part One, and would have had great resonance for readers of France under the July Monarchy and the Second Empire. Tiberius (42 B.C.E.–A.D. 37) succeeded Caesar Augustus as Roman emperor (14–37). His reign was marked by the execution of political enemies and legendary debauchery on the island of Capri.

##### Cenobitism:
i.e., those living in cloistered religious communities.

### 2.7.8: Faith, Law

#### Donougher: Faith Rules

##### Thales:
Writing in the third century AD in *Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers*, Diogenes Laertius describes Thales of Miletus (c.624–c.546 BC) as one attached to a solitary and reclusive life.

##### We must die … La Trappe echoes Horace:
Horace, Odes II:3: ‘moreris / Victima nil miserantis Orci. / Omnes eodem cogimur, omnium / Versatur urna serius ocius / Sors exitura et nos in aeternum / Exilium impositura cumbae’ (‘you will die, victim of none-sparing Orcus. We are all compelled to go there, a turn of the urn determines the fate of all and sooner or later imposes on us embarkation for eternal exile’). Founded in 1140, the monastery of La Trappe acquired its modern reputation for austerity in the late seventeenth century under the rule of Armand de Rance (1626–1700), nominally abbot from a very young age. For many years he led a dissolute life, but he underwent a conversion in the late 1650s and introduced a strict ascetic rule with which the name of the reformed Cistercian monastery is now synonymous. It was an erroneous popular belief that the monks of La Trappe greeted each other with the words ‘Memento mori’ and that they daily dug their own graves.

##### Leibniz:
The German mathematician and rationalist philosopher Gottfried von Leibniz (1646–1716), who discovered integral and differential calculus (independently of Isaac Newton), argued that God of necessity must exist and could not but choose the most perfect universe; therefore this world is the best of all possible worlds (a claim satirized by Voltaire in his novel *Candide*, 1759). Leibniz defended prayers as useful ‘because the idea or the foreknowledge of our prayers aided the divine understanding when it arranged the universe’ (Lloyd Strickland, *The Shorter Leibniz Texts: A Collection of New Translations*, London: Continuum, 2006, p. 102).

##### *Deo erexit Voltaire*
‘Voltaire raised [this building] to God.’ In 1760 Voltaire retired to his estate at Ferney, where he built a church for the villagers that bore this inscription.

#### Rose/Madden: Faith, Law

##### Thales:
Thales of Miletus (ca. 624–546 B.C.E.); a pre-Socratic philosopher regarded as the founder of the Greek schools of philosophy and science.

##### The abbé of La Trappe … Horace’s lines with him:
the abbey of La Trappe became famous for its strict of observance of the Cistercian rule. A philosophical fatalism unites the austere monk of La Trappe with the poet of first-century Rome.

##### Leibniz at prayer … Voltaire at worship:
The German mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716) was a rationalist and firm believer in God. In *Candide* (1756), Voltaire made Dr. Pangloss the satirically reductive voice of Leibniz’s philosophical optimism in “this the best of all possible worlds.” The deist Voltaire believed in the “watchmaker god” who had created a brilliant machine but was indifferent to its operations, including prayer.

##### *Deo erexit Voltaire*:
“A monument to God, erected by Voltaire,” the inscription on the church Voltaire had built in the village of Ferney (see here). Whatever his hostility to politicized religious institutions such as the Catholic Church (the object of his legendary motto *“Écrasez l’Infame,”* “Crush the Infamous One”), he believed that religion was necessary to provide moral guidance to the masses. He also promoted such cottage industries as pottery and watchmaking in Ferney, as work was also necessary to social order. It is worth noting that Voltaire’s church is dedicated to God, not to any religion or saint.

> the patriarch of Ferney: Voltaire spent much of the last half of his life on an estate at Ferney, near the Swiss border, in case prudence dictated an absence from French territory.

#### Donougher: Mère Innocente

##### Dom Mabillon … Merlonus Horstius:
In 1641 the Dutch theologian Jacobus Merlonus Horstius – there are numerous variant spellings of this name – (1597–1644) published in Cologne an edition of *The Works of St Bernard*, including letters. The Benedictine monk Jean Mabillon (1632–1707) published an edition of *The Works* in 1667. Mabillon is also the author of a celebrated work entitled *Réflexions sur les prisons des ordres religieux* (Reflections on the Prisons of Religious Orders; written 1690, published 1724), which exposed and condemned the *in pace* as inhuman.

##### a Jansenist:
The Augustinian-inspired teachings of Cornelius Jansen (1585–1638), bishop of Ypres, published after his death, were regarded by the Roman Catholic Church as heretical on the issues of grace and predestination. Fuelled by anti-papalism and an ascetic spirituality, and centred on the Cistercian religious communities of the Port-Royal abbeys, Jansenism attracted influential supporters in France but was vigorously opposed by the Jesuits, the papacy and Louis XIV. By the mid eighteenth century it was in decline, although the spirit of Jansenism persisted into the nineteenth century.

##### Cardinal de Bérulle:
Died of an apoplexy at the altar on 2 October 1629.

##### *Hanc igitur oblationem:*
The beginning of the eucharistic prayer in the canon of the mass, pronounced by the celebrant over the offerings of bread and wine before the consecration. ‘Wherefore we beseech thee, O Lord, graciously to receive this oblation …’

##### St Diodorus … Acarus:
St Diodorus (died c.392) was bishop of Tarsus. *Acarus* means ‘tick’, ‘mite’.

##### Portus:
There is no record of a St Terence who was bishop of Portus.

##### Bernard Guidonis:
Bishop of Tuy in Galicia, then of Lodève; inquisitor of Toulouse against the Albigensians, the Dominican Bernard Guidonis (or Gui; 1261–1331) was born and died in France.

##### Plantavit de la Fosse:
Jean de Plantavit de la Pause (1579–1651) was bishop of Lodève from 1625; Guillaume Plantavit de la Pause (1684–1760), abbot of Margon, retired to a Bernardine abbey and wrote a number of works of religious history.

##### St Benedict II … Constantine Pogonatus:
St Benedict II (elected to the papacy in 683, died in 685) was pope-elect for eleven months before his position was confirmed by the Byzantine emperor Constantine IV (c.652–85).

##### Constans:
The youngest son of the Byzantine emperor Constantine the Great, Constans (c.320–50) was emperor of the Western Roman Empire from 337 to 350.

##### *Stat crux dum volvitur orbis*:
‘The cross remains steady while the world turns’, the motto of the contemplative Carthusian Order, founded in the eleventh century by St Bruno (c.1032–1101).

##### Bernard … Abelard … de Bruys … Henry … Apostolicals … Arnold of Brescia … Radulf … Porée … Étoile … Louis the Young … Eugenius III … Templars:
At the Council of Sens (1140), the writings and teachings of the scholastic philosopher and theologian Peter Abelard (1079–1142), challenged by Bernard of Clairvaux, were condemned as heretical, and in consequence Abelard was sentenced to monastic isolation. Pierre de Bruys was burned as a heretic in 1126 and his disciple Henry of Lausanne was arrested in 1145/6 and sentenced to life imprisonment. Apostolicals is a designation loosely applied to a twelfth-century heretical grouping with pretensions to an apostolic way of life. Abelard’s disciple Arnold of Brescia (c.1100–c.1155) was eventually executed in Rome. Bernard deplored the anti-Jewish violence to which a Cistercian monk, Radulf, incited the population in the Rhineland at the time of the Second Crusade (1145–9), and took measures to curtail his activities. Gilbert de la Porée, bishop of Poitiers (1070–1154), was censured by the Council of Reims (1148) for some of his teachings about the Trinity, a judgement to which he bowed without protest. A self-appointed messiah, the Breton monk Éon de l’Étoile was deemed insane at the Council of Reims and sentenced to the seclusion of a monastery. Louis VII, known as Louis the Young (1120–80), was prevailed upon by St Bernard to join the Second Crusade (proclaimed by Pope Eugenius III in 1145, the year of his election to the papacy). The first Cistercian to become pope, Eugenius III (died 1153) presided over the Council of Reims. The rule of the Knights Templars, dating from the Council of Troyes in 1128, was inspired by St Bernard.

##### the Basil of the West:
Particularly revered in the Eastern Christian Churches, St Basil the Great (330–79), bishop of Caesarea, was born in Cappadocia. He founded the Basilian monastic order and is regarded as the father of Eastern monasticism, his influence on the monastic tradition extending to the Western Church.

##### Bernard of the Poor Catholics:
Bernard Primus was the first superior of the mendicant Order of the Poor Catholics, founded in 1208 to combat the Albigensian heresy.

##### Yet César de Bus … far from blessed:
In the French text, ‘Pourtant César de Bus est un bienheureaux, et Voltaire est un malheureaux.’ A French Catholic priest who founded two religious congregations devoted to the teaching of Christian doctrine, César de Bus (1544–1607) was declared Venerable in 1821. He would not formally have been called Blessed (‘bienheureaux’) until he was beatified in 1975, but Mère Innocente is using the term a little more loosely, in contrast with the ‘malheureux’ (‘wretched’) Voltaire.

##### Périgord … Gondren … Bourgoing … Senault … Père de la Ste-Marthe:
The churchman Alexandre-Angélique de Talleyrand-Périgord (1736–1821), uncle of Talleyrand the politician, was made cardinal in 1817 and archbishop of Paris later the same year. Father Charles de Gondren was the second superior of the Oratorians; he was succeeded in 1641 by François Bourgoing, who died in 1662. The Belgian theologian Jean-François Senault was Bourgoing’s successor, and following his death in 1672 Louis de la Sainte-Marthe (1621–97) became the superior of the order.

##### Père Coton:
Pierre Coton (or Cotton; 1564–1626) and St Francis of Sales (1567–1622) were both strong supporters of the founding of the French Oratorian Congregation by Pierre de Bérulle.

##### The name of Père Coton  […] the Huguenot king Henri IV:
Confessor to Henri IV, the Jesuit priest Pierre Coton is supposed to have prevailed on the king to stop blaspheming by changing his favourite oath, ‘Je renie Dieu’, ‘I deny God’, to ‘Je renie Coton’, which became shortened to ‘jarnicoton’.

##### [St Francis of Sales] […] cheated at cards:
This accusation is reported (in her vast correspondence, by the German-born Duchesse d’Orléans, Charlotte-Élisabeth, Princess Palatine; 1652–1722) to have been made by Marshal Nicolas de Neufville de Villeroi (1598–1685).

##### Sagittarius … Salonius … Mummulus:
Gregory of Tours (539–94) relates in his History of the Franks (bk IV) that an incursion into Gaul by the Lombards in the early 570s was defeated by the Comte d’Auxerre, Ennius Mummulus, at the head of a Burgundian army, with the two brother bishops Sagittarius and Salonius taking part in the battle – and, ‘what is worse’, killing many by their own hand.

##### St Martin of Tours:
St Martin (316–97), born in Hungary, came to Gaul as a soldier, where according to legend he shared his cloak with a beggar and was subsequently baptized. He lived as a monk for many years and about 371, by the will of the people, was made bishop of Tours.

##### St Leo II:
Pope Leo II (died 683) had to wait even longer than his successor St Benedict II for his election to the papacy (in 681) to be confirmed (in 682) by the imperial authority, represented in Italy by the exarch of Ravenna. Spain was at that time ruled by the Visigoths; there are extant some letters that Leo sent to Spain by the notary Peter, one of which is addressed to King Ervig.

##### Gautier … Duc de Bourgogne:
When Robert de Molesme founded the Cistercian Order in 1098, his new abbey was built on land granted to him by Eudes, sometimes Othon (in various spellings), Duc de Bourgogne; Robert was installed as abbot by Gautier, bishop of Châlons (1080–1121).

##### Arnold de Wyon, Gabriel Bucelin, Trithemius, Maurolycus … Luc d’Achéry:
Benedictine scholars who wrote about the order and its most illustrious figures: the Flemish Arnold de Wyon (1554–?), author of *Lignum Vitae* (Tree of Life: History of the Order of St Benedict); the German ecclesiastical historian Gabriel Bucelin (1599–1681); the humanist historian Abbot Johannes Trithemius (1462–1516); the Sicilian-born Greek mathematician and astronomer Franciscus Maurolycus (1494–1575); Luc d’Achéry (1609–85), a Benedictine of the Congregation of St-Maur.

##### Emperor Henry II:
Crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Benedict VIII (died 1024) in 1014, Henry II (972–1024) was canonized in 1147. Benedict’s election to the papacy in 1012 had been opposed by the antipope Gregory VI, who appealed to Henry for his support but was denied it.

##### Two overcoats are a very good thing to have:
Fauchelevent has misheard the reverend mother, who spoke of two epithets (*surnoms*), not two overcoats (*surtouts*).

#### Rose/Madden: Mother Innocent

##### “Dom Mabillon” … “Me neither”:
Dom Mabillon (1623–1707), a Benedictine monk and scholar, author of *The Lives of the Benedictine Saints*. We will not follow Mother Innocent through all twists and turns of her erudition, which, though Hugo gently mocks it, was his own as well. Yves Gohin attributes this scene to Hugo’s love of reading dictionaries, in this case Louis Moreri’s *Catholic Encyclopaedia*, first published in 1649. Several of the authorities and examples Mother Innocent cites are erroneous or simply inventions of Hugo’s. Old man Fauchelevent’s uncomprehending goodwill (“Me neither”) toward Merlonus Horstius confirms Hugo’s lighthearted touch in this scene, in which one can see the hand of Hugo the playwright.

##### “a Jansenist, Madame de Béthune”:
The ducal Béthune family descended from the family of Sully, the great minister of Henri IV. The Jansenists were Catholic reformers who believed in austerity and predestination. The movement was ferociously opposed by the Vatican, the powerful Jesuits, and Louis XIV. Largely stamped out in the early eighteenth century, Jansenism continued to trouble the religious and political establishment for many years.

##### *“Hanc igitur oblationem”*:
“With this sacrifice.” In the Catholic Church, these words begin the prayer with which the officiant presents the host, the body of Christ.

##### “the emp—Buonaparte”:
Father Fauchelevent is careful to use the appropriate language to describe the usurper.

##### *“Stat crux dum volvitur orbis”*:
“The cross remains standing as the world turns.”

##### “he brought down Abelard at the Council of Sens”:
In a celebrated theological quarrel, the scholar and theologian Pierre Abelard (1079–1142), best remembered as the lover of Héloïse, debated the more orthodox Bernard of Clairvaux before a Church tribunal at Sens. The council ruled in favour of Bernard and condemned Abelard as a heretic.

##### “King Louis the Young”:
i.e., Louis VII, born 1120, reigned 1137–1180.

##### “Eugenius III”:
pope from 1145 to 1153, he gave the Knights Templar—i.e., the Temple—an official status in the Church and sponsored the Second Crusade.

##### “Monte Cassino”:
the site of Saint Benedict’s first abbey; see here.
> he was old and … hermit: Hugo seems to be playing on the old French proverb “When the devil gets old, he’ll become a monk.” One of the abbeys Saint Benedict founded is the famous abbey of Monte Cassino, previously the site of a pagan temple dedicated to Apollo.

##### “the Basil of the West”:
Basil of Caesarea, or Saint Basil the Great (ca. 330–79), one of the fathers of the Eastern and Roman churches.

##### “the Huguenot king Henri IV”:
Mother Innocent, after more than two hundred years, seems suspicious of the sincerity of Henri IV’s conversion (see here).

> the wars of religion: At the end of the sixteenth century, clashes between Protestants and Catholics erupted into civil war, coming to a head when the Protestant King Henri IV inherited the throne from his cousin, Charles IX, last of the Valois dynasty. The wars ended when Henri converted to Catholicism, reasoning, according to legend, that Paris was well worth a mass.

Henri’s confessor, Father Coton, persuaded the earthy Béarnais to refrain from using blasphemous expletives, at least in the priest’s presence.

##### “Martin of Tours”:
Saint Martin of Tours (ca. 316–97), the first Christian bishop of Tours and an influential figure in the early Church. While serving as an officer in the Roman cavalry, Martin came upon a beggar shivering in the cold. He cut his cloak in half and gave half to the beggar. That night he had a dream of Jesus wearing his cloak, and when he awoke his cloak was whole again. Martin declared himself a soldier of Christ, quit the army, and took holy orders.
