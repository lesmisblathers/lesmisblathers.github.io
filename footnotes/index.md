#### Donougher: Some Figures in the Gloom
**Marguerite de Blemeur:** The Benedictine nun Jacqueline Bouette de Blemur (1618–96) is the author of *L’année bénédictine, ou les vies des saints de l’ordre de S. Benoît* (The Benedictine Year, or the Lives of the Saints of the Order of St Benedict), 1667–73.

**Madame Dacier:** Anne Dacier (1654–1720) was a noted scholar and translator of the classics, including Homer’s *Iliad* (1699) and *Odyssey* (1708).

**Ceracchi:** Giuseppe Ceracchi (1751–1801) was an Italian neoclassical sculptor who lived and worked in England, America, Holland, Prussia and Austria, before finally moving to Paris. He was guillotined in 1801 after becoming embroiled in a conspiracy against Napoleon.

**Gauvain … Drouet … Cogolludo … d’Auverney … Cifuentes … La Miltière … Laudinière … Sigüenza … Suzon:** Hugo has used in this paragraph names connected with his own life: Julienne Gauvain, better known as Juliette Drouet (1806–83), was his mistress and devoted companion from 1833 until her death. During the Peninsular War, Hugo’s father was made general and governor of the central provinces of Spain and given the title count by the then king of Spain Joseph Bonaparte. Cogolludo, Cifuentes and Sigüenza are all towns located in the Spanish central province of Guadalajar, which came under General Hugo’s governorship. Hugo’s maternal grandfather was born at Auvergné near Nantes; Hugo wrote some of his early articles under the name d’Auverney, and gave the name Auverney to one of the main characters in his first novel, *Bug-Jargal*, written when he was sixteen. La Miltière is the country estate of which l’Audinière was a smaller part, bought by General Hugo and his second wife in 1823, and is where Victor Hugo’s first child, Léopold, who died aged three months, was buried. ‘Suzette et Suzon’ is a poem by Hugo, published posthumously in the collection *Toute la Lyre* (1888 and 1893) and set to music by Saint-Saëns.

**Île Bourbon:** Claimed as French territory in 1642, this island in the Indian Ocean, named Île Bourbon in 1649, was renamed Île de la Réunion in 1793, retaining that name since 1848.

**Chevalier Roze:** The nobleman Nicolas Roze (1675–1733) distinguished himself during the epidemic of plague in Marseille in 1720 by his devoted and selfless service, particularly in organizing the burial of the dead. He himself contracted the disease, but survived.

**‘What a devil of a noise!’**: In the French text, ‘C’est le diable à quatre’. With Madame de Genlis’s signature four rings in mind, Hugo here is playing on the expression *faire le diable à quatre,* meaning ‘to create a great deal of noise and disorder’ and said to derive from medieval morality plays featuring four characters – the devil and his lieutenants.

#### Rose/Madden: A Few Silhouettes in the Shadows
**Marguerite de Blemeur:** a seventeenth-century (1618–96) nun and scholar who wrote the Lives of the Saints of the Order of Saint Benedict.

**the Dacier of the Order:** its scholar, Anne Dacier (1647–1720), was an accomplished woman of letters who translated classical authors from Sappho and Aristophanes to Plautus and Terence.

**Mademoiselle Gauvain … Mademoiselle de Siguenza:** Several of the names Hugo gives here have resonance in his own life. Gauvain, for example, was the real family name of his longtime mistress, Juliette Drouet. Cogolludo, Cifuentes, and Siguenza were fiefs granted to Hugo’s father by Joseph Bonaparte in Spain; Miltière and Laudinière were properties purchased by General Hugo under the Restoration; Auverné near Nantes was the birthplace of Hugo’s mother, Sophie Trébuchet.

**the Isle of Bourbon … Roze:** Réunion, in the Indian Ocean, now an overseas department (Département d’Outre-Mer, DOM) of France. The chevalier Roze was Nicolas Roger Roze (1675–1733), who worked heroically to alleviate the conditions in Marseilles during the plague of 1720.

### 2.6.8

#### Donougher: Post Corda Lapides

**Post Corda Lapides**: Latin: Literally, ‘After the hearts, the stones.’

**the eleven thousand devils’ playground:** In his book *William Shakespeare*, Hugo refers (bk 1, ch. 3) to a drinking establishment, founded by the Vicomte de Montauban, called ‘le Tripot des onze mille diables’. A gang of bandits who ravaged the Limousin and Auvergne area in the mid sixteenth century were known as the ‘eleven thousand devils’. (A leader of the gang, Jean de Cathalando, repented of his misdeeds and became a Franciscan friar at the monastery of Sellières.)

**Rue Droit-Mur ... Rue des Églantiers**: *Droit-Mur* means ‘straight wall’. *Églantier* is the sweet briar, or wild rose.

#### Rose/Madden: Post Corda Lapides
**Post corda lapides:** “After the hearts, the stones.”

**_a jeu de paume_ … “eleven thousand devils”:** The *jeu de paume* (predecessor of the tennis court) was another landmark on the left bank near the convent of the rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève.
