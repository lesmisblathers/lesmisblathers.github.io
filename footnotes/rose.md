## Book 1: A Just Man
### 1.1.1: Monsieur Myriel
1. Myriel was bishop of Digne: Hugo based his bishop on Charles-François-Melchior-Bienvenu de Miollis (1753–1838), bishop of Digne from 1805 to 1831. Like his fictional counterpart, Miollis was known for the simplicity of his lifestyle and his attention to the poorest members of his diocese. Miollis also welcomed a convict named Pierre Maurin, who had spent five years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread (with aggravating circumstances). Several details of Bishop Myriel’s life are inventions of the novelist and were even criticized by conservative Catholics, who saw Myriel’s lifestyle as a rebuke of the Church, and by the surviving members of Miollis’s family. <br/> The town of Digne was also a fortuitous location for Bishop Myriel’s good works, given that digne means “worthy” in French. The bishop’s name may suggest other meanings. The -iel ending recalls the traditional names of the archangels (Gabriel, Raphael, Michael, Uriel). The name also has a certain assonance with miel, “honey.”

2. noblesse de robe: the hereditary class of magistrates who made up the parlements, the law courts of ancien régime France. The robins were considered one rung below the noblesse d’épée, the nobility of the sword, the dukes, counts, and so on, of the old feudal-military order.

3. tragic scenes of ’93: The year 1793, the fourth year of the French Revolution, saw some of the bloodiest episodes of the era, from the trial and execution of Louis XVI in January to Marie Antoinette’s in October, as well as the beginning of the Terror. Hugo’s last novel, Quatre-vingt-treize (Ninety-three), a story of political conflict in revolutionary Brittany, was published in 1874.

4. émigrés: Usually taken to refer to aristocrats, the term can refer to anyone who fled France for political reasons during the Revolution.

5. 1804: In 1804, Consul for Life Napoléon Bonaparte, de facto dictator of France since 1799, became emperor of the French. The coronation of December 2 was officiated by Pope Pius VII in the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris.

6. curé of Brignolles: The title curé, curate, was used to describe almost any priest, as was the courtesy title abbé, abbot. Brignolles is a small town in the Provence region. The place names Hugo cites throughout the novel are mostly real, from the Midi to the Paris region later on in the story.

7. Cardinal Fesch: Joseph Fesch (1763–1839), Napoléon’s uncle—his mother’s younger half brother—was named archbishop of Lyon and ambassador to the Vatican by his nephew.

8. the Midi: the south of France.

9. Monseigneur: literally, “my lord,” the formal title used to address bishops; the humble Myriel, unlike his housekeeper, prefers the less pompous Monsieur.

10. imperial decree, which ranked bishops … field marshals: Napoléon was highly conscious of issues of rank and protocol and in arranging the etiquette of his new imperial court.

### 1.1.2 Monsieur Myriel Becomes Monseigneur Bienvenu
1. Monseigneur Henri Puget … abbé of Simore: bishop of Digne (1708–28) and abbot of Simore. Under the ancien régime, bishops often held one or (usually) more abbeys, which supplemented their incomes.

2. Charles Brûlart de Genlis, archbishop prince of Embrun … lord bishop of Senez: In the early Middle Ages, Embrun was a free city ruled by the archbishop, who was recognized as a prince. The title was used as a courtesy after Embrun officially became subject to the French Crown in the sixteenth century. Under the ancien régime, several bishoprics carried with them secular titles and offices—such as lord bishops and bishop barons, described below—and even political authority. As was increasingly the case in the eighteenth century, the archbishop of Genlis was from an aristocratic family; Crillon and Sabran in particular were great names of the French nobility; Antoine de Mesgrigny, Capuchin bishop of Grasse, was both a Capuchin monk and a priest, a status more common in the Middle Ages than in later eras. Philippe de Vendôme, grand prior of France, descended from César de Vendôme, an acknowledged bastard of King Henri IV and Gabrielle d’Estrées. Philippe (1655–1727), in spite of his clerical status, had a prominent military career, being named grand prior of the Knights of Malta before succeeding his elder brother as the fourth and last Duc de Vendôme. The abbey of Saint-Honoré de Lérins was one of many that provided an income to the princely warrior-monk.

3. Manosque, and Sisteron: two cities in the Provence region of France, within Bishop Myriel’s diocese.

4. imperial senator: Napoléon created the Senate in imitation of Rome, in order to give the gloss of a constitutional order to his government and as a means to honour high-ranking or prestigious citizens. Senators were provided with substantial endowments, often including country houses or châteaux, such as the “magnificent senatorial seat” mentioned here. The senator in question received his sénatorerie in return for supporting Bonaparte’s seizure of power in the coup d’état of the Eighteenth Brumaire of November 9, 1799—18 brumaire, year VII, according to the Revolutionary calendar still in effect—that brought Bonaparte to power. The Consulate (with Bonaparte as first consul and then consul for life) replaced the Directoire.

5. Council of Five Hundred: Under the Directoire government that followed the fall of Robespierre and the Convention, the Council of the Five Hundred was the lower and larger of the two legislative bodies, paired with the Conseil des Anciens, or Council of Elders.

6. Monsieur Bigot de Préameneu: Félix Bigot de Préameneu (1747–1825), Napoléon’s ministre des cultes, or minister of public worship, also one of the authors of the Napoleonic Code.

7. “the Durance at Château-Arnoux”: The Durance River flows down through the Alps to the Rhone, crossing much of Bishop Myriel’s diocese, including the city of Château-Arnoux.

8. Things were not good with Rome at that point: After Napoléon had restored the Catholic Church to its official place in French society by the Concordat of 1801 and Pius VII had officiated at Napoléon’s coronation of December 1, 1804, the relationship between Paris and Rome steadily deteriorated (see here). Caesar is the senator’s flattering reference to the still-new emperor of the French.

### 1.1.3: A Good Bishop for a Hard Bishopric
1. Senez … once an episcopal city: The town of Senez lost its episcopal status in the reorganization of the French church in 1790.

2. “the right to mow … else”: i.e., those widows and orphans would have been allowed to sell their hay at the highest prices possible, without competititon from their neighbours.

3. engraved stationery: or papier timbré, stamped paper, which bore the official government stamp and was required for all legal documents. A metaphor for the expense of lawsuits.

### 1.1.4: He Puts His Money Where His Mouth Is
1. a peerage … grandfather: Under the Restoration, the Charter, or constitution, provided for a bicameral legislature of elected deputies in the lower house, and a Chamber of Peers, appointed by the king, with a limited number of hereditary seats.

2. “Saint Augustine”: Saint Augustine (354–430) was one of the Fathers of the Church.

3. ultra-royalist and an ultra-Voltairean at once: not so rare a combination, as many aristocrats before and after the Revolution superficially affected the cynical subversiveness of Voltaire while clinging to the ultra-royalist politics that ensured their position and authority.

4. “tax on doors and windows”: effectively a luxury tax on home owners, it was, as the bishop implies, a grossly regressive and unfair tax.

5. public prosecutor: Under the royal governments before and after the Revolution, public prosecutors were extremely powerful, especially in local governments.

6. You may think you are indifferent to the death penalty: Opposition to the death penalty was a lifelong cause of Hugo, surviving all of his political permutations. His novel The Last Day of a Condemned Man (1829), a first-person narrative of a man facing execution, was a powerful and eloquent condemnation of the death penalty.

7. Maistre … Beccaria: The conservative count Joseph de Maistre (1753–1821) was one of the leading politcal theorists of legitimacy and conservatism in post-Napoleonic France; Marquis Cesare di Beccaria (1738–94) was an Italian philosopher and politician whose treatise On Crime and Punishment (1764) advocated penal reform and the abolition of torture and the death penalty.

### 1.1.5: How Monseigneur Bienvenu Made His Cassocks Last Too Long
1. canon … grand-vicars: subalterns of bishops. Canons were priests associated with various chapters of a cathedral; grand-vicars assisted bishops in conducting the business of their dioceses.

2. purple overcoat, purple stockings: Purple was the traditional colour associated with bishops; like the three golden “spinach-seed” tassels, these are Myriel’s rare displays of his office.

3. As he made his cassocks last a very long time: During his years at Hauteville House, Hugo adopted the practice of turning his old coats inside out, as an object lesson in frugality to his middle-class peers.

4. “a Trappist”: The Trappist monks were known for the extreme austerity of their living conditions.

5. this passage in Genesis: Genesis 1:2.

6. Flavius Josephus: Jewish historian (ca. 37–ca. 95) whose magnum opus, Jewish Antiquities, chronicled the Jewish people from Creation to the reign of Nero. The Chaldean Bible that Hugo refers to is an Aramaic translation of the Pentateuch, rediscovered and published in Bologna in 1482.

7. Hugo, bishop of Ptolemaïs: Hugo’s relationship to the bishop-theologian Charles-Louis Hugo (1667–1739) was a family tradition that does not stand up to close genealogical examination.

8. Oh, Thou who art! … the most beautiful: Hugo’s list of many names of God in the Bible ends with “Mercy,” Miséricorde in French, Misericordia in Latin, the most beautiful of all the names of God.

### 1.1.6: How He Protected His House
1. a huge bergère: an upholstered armchair.

2. forty-two francs and ten sous: The franc was established as the basic unit of currency in 1795, but the names of old currencies persisted well into the nineteenth century. The term livre, or pound, was used interchangeably with franc through most of the nineteenth century. A sou was worth five centimes, so twenty sous equaled one franc, or one livre; a five-franc coin was often called a pièce de cent sous, a hundred-sous coin. The reader will also encounter the écu, a coin worth three francs, and the gold louis, worth twenty francs.

3. abbé of Grand-Champ, Order of Cîteaux: Following the monastic rule established by Saint Robert of Molesme, the first abbot of Cîteaux, the Cistercian monasteries, such as the abbey of Grand-Champ, were known for their austerity.

4. appointed by the king: According to the long-established tradition of Gallicanism, the French monarchs controlled the vast majority of clerical appointments in their kingdom. This tradition survived the Revolution and well into the nineteenth century.

5. two wax candles: wax candles, as opposed to the cheaper tallow variety found in most poor homes.

6. Tournefort … Linnaeus: Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (1656–1708), Bernard de Jussieu (1699–1777), and Charles de Linné (1707–78), who used the Latinized name of Linnaeus when publishing his learned treatises, were all famous botanists.

7. “Nisi Dominus custodierit domum, in vanum vigilant qui custodiunt eam”: “If a house is not watched over by the Lord, those who watch over it do so in vain.”

### 1.1.7: Cravatte
1. Gaspard Bès’s gang of crooks: Gaspard Bès was a bandit, captured and executed in 1781. Cravatte is an invention of Hugo.

2. Piedmont: not just the region but at the time a separate country, part of the Kingdom of Savoy.

3. Joug-de-l’Aigle: literally, the Eagle’s Yoke, a high mountain pass in the French Alps.

4. to sing a Te Deum: A Te Deum is a mass of thanksgiving to God.

5. Our Lady of Embrun: i.e., the Cathedral of Notre Dame d’Embrun.

### 1.1.8: Philosophy After a Drink or Two
1. Epicurus: a Greek philosopher of the third century B.C.E. who advocated the pursuit of contentment in life.

2. Pigault-Lebrun: Guillaume-Charles-Antoine Pigault de l’Épiney (1753–1835), who published under the name Pigault-Lebrun, was known for his scandalously libertine and antireligious writings, largely forgotten today.

3. “the marquis d’Argen, Pyrrhon, Hobbes, and Monsieur Naigeon”: A comically ignorant hodgepodge of names. The Marquis d’Argen (1704–71) was best known for his wit, largely forgotten today; Pyrrhon (third century B.C.E.) was one of the first of the Greek sceptic philosphers; the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679), one of the most influential of European philosophers, is best known for his Leviathan and his assertion that life, in the state of nature, is nasty, brutish, and short; Monsieur Naigeon was a publisher and friend of Diderot.

4. “Diderot”: Denis Diderot (1713–84), along with Voltaire and Rousseau one of the greatest figures of the French Enlightenment. An archrationalist and atheist, Diderot was best known in his time as the co-editor (with d’Alembert) of the Encyclopédie, the great compendium of Enlightenment rationalism; he was also an essayist, playwright, and novelist. The senator’s opinions on Diderot reveal him to be a man of dangerously little knowledge.

5. “even more of a bigot than Voltaire”: bigot in the sense of the French word bigot, meaning someone of narrow-minded and intolerant religious orthodoxy. If anyone could be less of a bigot than the deist Voltaire, it was the atheist Diderot.

6. “Needham”: Jean Turberville Needham (1713–81) is best remembered today as a target for Voltaire’s satire, directed at Needham’s belief in spontaneous generation.

7. “fiat lux”: Genesis 1:3, “Let there be light.”

8. “The fas and the nefas”: good and evil, or right and wrong.

9. “Tertullian”: a classical writer and early convert to Christianity (ca. 160–240).

10. “Moniteur”: the quasi-official journal of government proceedings from 1799 to 1901.

11. “Inter pocula”: “among drinkers,” i.e., among friends.

12. “Panthéon”: During the Revolution, the Church of Saint Geneviève was renamed the Panthéon and dedicated as the mausoleum of heroes of the nation. The great Revolutionary orator Mirabeau was the first man interred there, followed by the disinterred remains of Voltaire. After being restored to its original purpose as a church by the Restoration government in 1815, the building was converted back into a national mausoleum in 1884, just in time to receive the mortal remains of Victor Hugo.

13. “Sardanapalus or Vincent de Paul”: two antithetical figures: Sardanapalus was, according to legend and Lord Byron, the debauched last king of Babylon; Saint Vincent de Paul (1576–1660) founded two religious orders, one of priests, one of nuns, dedicated to active service to the poor. Vincent was known for his personal humility and gentle piety.

14. “niente”: Italian for “nothing.”

15. “Cato … Stephen … Joan of Arc”: three martyrs to principle. The Roman senator Cato the Younger (95–46 B.C.E.) fled Rome and later killed himself rather than submit to Julius Caesar; Saint Stephen was martyred by stoning in first-century Jerusalem; Saint Joan of Arc, “the Maid of Orléans,” was a peasant girl from Lorraine who presented herself to the court of King Charles VIII and announced that God had sent her to drive the English out of France. After leading the French armies to near-total victory, Joan was abandoned to the English, who tried her as a heretic and burned her at the stake in 1431.

### 1.1.9: The Brother as the Sister Tells It
1. Telemachus … Minerva: i.e., scenes from Télémaque, or Telemachus, Son of Odysseus, a widely read novel by François de La Mothe-Fénelon (1656–1715), archbishop of Cambrai and tutor to the grandchildren of Louis XIV, who borrowed from Homer to craft a moral lesson for the duke of Burgundy, heir presumptive to the throne.

### 1.1.10: The Bishop Before an Unknown Light
1. the National Convention: the legislative body that governed the First Republic after the abolition of the monarchy in September 1792. It was the Convention that tried and executed Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, made war on Austria and Prussia, and eventually gave rise to the infamous Comité de Salut Public. Danton and Robespierre were the great leaders of the Convention. It was under the Convention that such egalitarian measures as using only the familiar, informal tu form and the titles of citoyen and citoyenne replaced monsieur and madame.

2. a semi-regicide: Those members of the National Convention—the majority—who voted for the execution of Louis XVI were known as regicides. Some voted for exile, some for death with a suspended sentence, which was a symbolic vote that amounted to exile. Those who did not vote for the death penalty for the “tyrant” were viewed with suspicion as being lukewarm in Revolutionary sentiment, a distinctly unhealthy position. With the return of the legitimate princes in 1814, and even more so after the Hundred Days, many regicides faced prosecution and were usually sentenced to exile.

3. Azrael, the Mohammedan angel of the sepulchre: Azrael, the archangel of death, is never mentioned in the Qu’ran but is part of several extracanonical traditions.

4. “fatal return of the past known as 1814”: i.e., the return of the Bourbon monarchy, albeit in a much-changed form.

5. “’93”: see here.

6. “Louis XVII”: the son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette; recognized as King Louis XVII (1785–95) by royalists, he was in fact the great-grandson of Louis XV. Declared a ward of the Republic after his father’s execution, he was raised in the Temple prison by brutal guardians, forbidden to see his mother and sister even while they were in the same compound. The boy, who died in 1795, was known to royalists as “the Martyr of the Temple.”

7. “Cartouche’s brother”: Cartouche, born Louis-Dominique Bourguignon (1693–1721) was a Parisian bandit chief whose trial and subsequent public torture and execution in Paris in 1721—he was broken on a spiked wheel on the place de Grève—was a public spectacle, giving rise to a legend that made Cartouche seem larger than life. For Hugo, for whom the fight against the death penalty was lifelong and futile, such judicial spectacles, whether it was the wheel or the guillotine, were barbaric and dehumanizing.

8. “the place de Grève”: Today known as the place de l’Hôtel de Ville, on the right bank, the place de Grève was the site of public torture and executions from the Middle Ages until 1830, when it was given its present name.

9. “Sinite parvulos”: from the Gospel of Mark 10:14, “Suffer the little children to come unto me.”

10. “dauphin of Barabbas and the dauphin of Herod”: i.e., the children of the guilty. Barrabas was the criminal whose life was spared by Pontius Pilate at the demands of the Passover crowds, who thus abandoned Jesus Christ to crucifixion.

11. “draped in the fleur-de-lis”: The lily was the symbol of the French royal family from Louis IX (Saint Louis, born 1214, reigned 1226–70) to the Bourbons.

12. “gala-standard berlin”: A berlin was a large, elegant carriage, of the sort used in public processions.

13. “Vermis sum”: from Psalm 21, “I am a worm and no man.”

14. “Marat applauding the guillotine”: As a journalist and politician, Jean-Paul Marat (1743–93) was known for the exceptional violence of his rhetoric, including his role in inciting the September Massacres and the campaign against the moderate Girondins. His assassination in the bath by the royalist Charlotte Corday on July 13, 1793, memorialized in David’s hagiographic painting, made him a martyr to the Revolution. His remains were placed in the Panthéon, only to be removed scarcely a year later after the fall of Robespierre.

15. “Bossuet … Protestants”: Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet (1627–1704), bishop of Meaux, one of the leading clerics of Louis XIV’s reign. A gifted writer and orator, Bossuet was a staunch supporter of both Catholic orthodoxy and royal power. The Te Deum is a mass of thanksgiving in the Catholic Church. While Bossuet sought to bring Protestants back to the Catholic Church, the government often took more violent measures such as G—— alludes to. Dragonnades refers to a policy by which Protestants were forced to provide lodging to soldiers (specifically dragoons, the cavalry), who were tacitly encouraged to harrass their hosts into converting, often resulting in violence. More than two hundred thousand French Protestants, or Huguenots, fled France as a result of such policies.

16. “Carrier … marquis de Louvois”: Face-to-face with the royalist Bishop Myriel, G—— compares the excesses of the Revolution to those of Louis XIV’s persecution of the Huguenots in the late seventeenth century. Jean-Baptist Carrier (1757–94) was one of the most infamous prosecutors of the Terror, operating chiefly in the city of Nantes. Among his innovations were mass executions by drowning, in which boats carrying as many as one hundred bound prisoners were sunk in the Loire; he also invented the mariage républicain, in which a man and a woman judged guilty of counterrevolutionary activities were tied together and thrown into the river. Carrier was eventually executed for his excesses after the fall of Robespierre. Nicolas-Auguste de la Baume, Marquis de Montrevel (1636–1716), was a notorious persecutor of Protestants, as was Nicolas Lamoignon-Bâville (1648–1724). Antoine Fouquier-Tinville served as chief prosecutor for the trials supervised by the Committee for Public Safety, including Marie Antoinette’s; he was executed with Robespierre and Saint-Just after 9 Thermidor. Stanislas-Marie Maillard (1763–94) took part in many of the violent popular revolts of the Revolution, including the fall of the Bastille and the September Massacres, where he led the mob that murdered prisoners of the Abbaye prison. The duc Gaspard de Saulx-Tavannes (1509–73), Marshal of France, was one of the instigators of the Saint Bartholomew’s Day Massacre, one of the bloodiest incidents of the religious wars of the sixteenth century. Le père Duchêne was a newspaper edited by Jacques-René Hébert (1757–94), one of the most radical and violent of revolutionaries and a rival of Robespierre. Le père Le Tellier (1648–1719) was confessor to Louis XIV and encouraged the king’s harsh repression of Protestants and Jansenists (see here) alike. He was not related to François-Michel Le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois (1641–91); as minister of war and Louis’s closest adviser, Louvois encouraged and executed many of those policies, specifically the dragonnades. Jourdan-Coupe-Tête, Jourdan the Head Chopper, refers to Mathieu Jouve Jourdan (1749–94); a former butcher and soldier, Jourdan made his mark during the fall of the Bastille, when he is believed to have murdered the governor, the marquis de Launay; he was one of the most violent members of the mob that invaded Versailles on October 5, 1789, but it was in Avignon in 1791 that he earned his sobriquet: At the head of still another extralegal mob, he supervised the beheading of as many as sixty people. Jourdan was eventually arrested and executed by the Committee for Public Safety.

17. “Marie Antoinette, archduchess and queen”: Archduke and archduchess were the titles given to the children of the reigning Austrian Hapsburgs, Marie Antoinette’s family.

18. “poor Huguenot … Louis le Grand”: The Huguenots lived under the protection of Henri IV’s 1598 Edict of Nantes. Louis XIV—Louis le Grand, as G—— calls him with some irony—repealed the edict in 1685, giving rise to legal and social persecutions, such as the dragonnades referred to above, that led to the mass emigration of Protestants to England, Holland, Germany, and even the American colonies.

19. “Tantalus”: In Greek mythology, Tantalus was condemned to stand in a pool of water while suffering from a painful thirst. Whenever he stooped to drink, the water would recede from his reach. The verb “tantalize” comes from this myth.

20. “Your blessing,” said the bishop: one of the most controversial scenes in Les Misérables when the novel was published. The surviving family of Bishop de Miollis was particularly offended that the character so clearly modelled on their saintly ancestor should ask the blessing of a character like G——.

21. “red bonnet” … “hat”: The “red bonnet” is the Phrygian cap, favoured by the sans-culottes in imitation of the one worn by freed slaves in ancient Rome; the red hat refers to the cardinal’s hat.

### 1.1.11: A Qualification
1. “philosopher bishop” or “patriot priest”: two classic archetypes of the late-eighteenth-century French church. The “philosopher bishop,” the aristocratic prelate who flouted his vows of poverty, chastity, and humility, is epitomized by Talleyrand (see here), appointed to the bishopric of Autun just before the Revolution, who was known chiefly for his wit, his elegance, his gambling, and his womanizing; some thirty years his senior, Archbishop Dillon of Narbonne lived a princely lifestyle in a château near Paris, with his mistress, his stable and kennel for hunting, and massive debts. The “patriot priest” was the curé who adopted the principles of Revolution: the abbé Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès (1748–1836), author of the famous pamphlet Qu’est-ce que le tiers état? (What Is the Third Estate?) was more committed to the principles of Rousseau and Locke than to the Gospel, while the abbé Henri Grégoire (1750–1831) was committed to both the Church and the Republic; Grégoire was a defender of the rights of minorities, including Protestants and Jews, and devoted considerable energy to the abolition of slavery and the slave trade. Some have speculated that the abbé Grégoire was one of the models for the Conventionist G——; Grégoire was in fact a member of the Convention, absent on the day of the vote regarding Louis XVI’s sentence, and was a sincere believer.

2. The arrest of the pope … July 5–6, 1809: The tempestuous relationship between Pius VII, who had presided over Napoléon’s imperial coronation, culminated in the pope’s being forcibly taken from the Vatican to Fontainebleau, where he remained a prisoner until January 1814.

3. the synod of the bishops: The Concile National was held in June 1811 in an attempt to circumvent the pope’s refusal to recognize bishops appointed by the emperor. Monseigneur de Miollis attended the council and, along with the majority, supported the pope against Napoléon.

4. Ultramontane … Gallican: The Gallican tradition maintained the independence of the Catholic Church in France vis-à-vis Rome, surviving the Revolution well into the nineteenth century to the reign of Napoléon III; the Ultramontane (from the Latin for “beyond the mountains,” i.e., south of the Alps, Rome) favoured the authority of the pope over national interests. Monseigneur de Miollis was an Ultramontane.

5. refused to go and gawk: After Napoléon landed on the coast at Fréjus, near Cannes, in March 1815, huge crowds—many of them cheering—turned out along his route north to Paris, which passed near Digne.

6. having a command in Provence … determined to let him get away: Many in the French military had only grudgingly accepted the return of the Bourbons in 1814 and were sympathetic to Napoléon’s return, many of them far more enthusiastically than the bishop’s rather noncommittal brother. Bishop de Miollis’s brothers were a Napoleonic general and a magistrate.

7. The year 1812 comes along … In 1815, as the ultimate disasters were in the air: This passage describes the long decline of Napoléon, from the disastrous Russian campaign of 1812 to his defeat at the hands of the Allies during the 1813 German campaign, culminating in the French defeat at Leipzig in October; the “cowardly” and “taciturn legislative body” refers to the imperial Senate, which remained passive as the Allies approached Paris in March 1814, only to proclaim Napoléon’s fall under the leadership of Talleyrand. Napoléon finally agreed to abdicate when a number of his top generals, notably Maréchal Marmont, Duc de Raguse, publicly defected; many Bonapartists considered Marmont and his fellows to be “treacherous marshals.” The “ultimate disasters” are, of course, events leading up to the emperor’s last stand at Waterloo, where Allied armies led by Wellington put an end to the Napoleonic saga.

8. a legionnaire of Austerlitz: The French defeat of the combined forces of Austria, Prussia, and Russia at Austerlitz on December 2, 1805, was one of Napoléon’s greatest victories. Coming on the anniversary of his coronation, it consolidated his power at home and, for a time, shattered his European opposition.

9. eagle: symbol of the new French Empire.

10. the imperial profile had vanished: The returning Bourbons maintained the Legion of Honour, created by Bonaparte in 1803 to honour valour in warfare, but Napoléon’s profile was effaced from the medal, as it was from coinage.

11. “three toads”: apparently a dismissive reference to the three fleurs-de-lis that were a traditional symbol of the French monarchy.

12. “That gouty old bastard”: Louis XVIII suffered from gout and obesity; the pigtail is a reference to the king’s old-fashioned, powdered hairstyle.

13. Prussia and England: not only traditional enemies of France, but two countries that Napoléon particularly despised and distrusted.

### 1.1.12: Monseigneur Bienvenu’s Solitude
1. Saint Francis de Sales: As Roman Catholic bishop of Geneva, Sales (1567–1622) sought to convert Protestants back to the Catholic faith.

2. cadets: i.e., its subalterns.

3. metropolis: in the Roman Catholic Church, an archbishop’s diocese.

4. subdeacon: Such clerical “livings” were much sought after by young clerics, although many of the abuses of clerical livings were weeded out by Revolutionary and Napoleonic reforms.

5. more abbés than priests: i.e., leaning more toward politics and the secular life than spiritual and pastoral duties; again, such cases were far more common under the ancien régime than in the nineteenth century. Ambition was certainly present in the French Church in Hugo’s time, but it tended to aim toward bishoprics and cardinal’s hats rather than the diplomatic posts and ministerial portfolios of earlier ages.

6. conclavist: i.e., a member of the College of Cardinals, which meets in a papal conclave to elect a new pope.

7. the Rota: one of the highest of the canonical courts in the Church.

8. a pallium: a scarf-like ecclesiastical garment worn by certain prelates, usually archbishops.

9. Perrette: an allusion to a fable of La Fontaine: Perrette, a careless famer’s wife, dreaming of everything she will buy with the proceeds from the sale of her milk, trips and spills the milk pail balanced on her head.

10. Juvenal and Tacitus: Juvenal’s Satires, along with the Annals of Tacitus, were part of Hugo’s rigorous classical education. The two authors are frequent points of reference in Les Misérables.

11. Moses … Napoléon: It was typical of the French Romantics to include Napoléon among the historic geniuses who changed the world.

12. a sham Corneille write Tiridate: Jean-Gilbert de Campistron (1656–1723), whose Tiridate debuted at the Théâtre Français in 1691. Hugo was a great admirer of Corneille, whose work he vastly preferred to that of his contemporary Racine.

13. some military Prudhomme: an allusion to Wellington. Prudhomme and prudhommerie came to refer to banal mediocrity in nineteenth-century France, following the writer and illustrator Henri Monnier’s hugely successful caricature of the 1830s. Monnier’s Monsieur Prudhomme was well intentioned but also pretentious, vain, and ignorant. Hugo refers to prudhommerie frequently in Les Misérables.

14. Sambre-et-Meuse army: During the Revolution, armies were given the names of the new départements to replace the old system of aristocratic and provincial names.

15. Mousqueton’s … Claude’s: Mousqueton was the valet of Porthos in The Three Musketeers; Hugo held the successors of Caesar Augustus, including Claudius (10 B.C.E.–54), in low esteem, as the reader will see throughout Les Misérables.

### 1.1.13: What He Believed
1. Credo in Patrem: the opening phrase of the Apostle’s Creed in Latin: “I believe in the Father …”

2. quia multum amavit: an allusion to Christ’s public forgiveness of Mary Magdelene, from Luke 7:47: “Because she has loved much …”

3. the Brahmans: in Hinduism, the Brahman spirit is the eternal and transcendent spirit underlying all life.

4. “Who … the earth?”: Ecclesiastes 3:19–21.

5. Saint Francis of Assisi and Marcus Aurelius: Saint Francis (1181–1226) is traditionally associated with benevolence toward animals; the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (121–180), author of the Meditations, is recognized as a philosopher of the Stoic tradition.

6. Pope Gregory XVI: Pope from 1831 to 1846, the traditionalist Gregory was so opposed to modernism that he forbade the construction of railways in the Papal States. He took a similarly conservative view of politics, though it should be noted that, like Hugo, he was a vocal opponent of slavery.

### 1.1.14: What He Thought
1. Swedenborg or Pascal: The Swedish scientist Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1722) underwent a religious conversion at the age of fifty, when he claimed to have spoken to God and visited heaven and hell in mystic visions; his writings inspired a great number of followers in Europe. The mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal (1623–62) died at the age of thirty-nine while composing notes for a defence of the Christian faith; those notes, published under the title Pensées, remain one of the greatest expressions of religious thought in the French language. Pascal suffered from poor health all his life, certain symptoms of which may have been interpreted as madness.

2. Elijah’s mantle: In 2 Kings 2:8, the prophet Elijah, in company with Elisha, approaches the river Jordan. He rolls up his mantle and strikes the water. The water immediately divides, and Elijah and Elisha cross on dry land. Suddenly, a chariot of fire and horses of fire appear and Elijah is lifted up to heaven in a whirlwind. As Elijah is lifted up, his mantle falls to the ground and Elisha picks it up.

3. Saint Teresa and Saint Jerome: Saint Teresa of Ávila (1515–82) was a Spanish nun who experienced mystic visions; Saint Jerome (ca. 340–419), who translated the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament into the Latin Vulgate Bible, is counted as one of the Fathers of the Church.

4. Love one another: from the Gospel of John (13:34–35): “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.”

5. Lucretius … Dante: Hugo had named the Roman philosopher-poets Lucretius, Saint-Paul, and Dante “giants of the human spirit” in his essay “William Shakespeare.” He learned of the Indian philosopher Manu through a translation of The Laws of Manu, which had been published in Paris in 1840.

## Book 2: The Fall
### 1.2.1: The Night After a Day’s Walk
1. the mairie: the town hall and probably the residence of the mayor.

2. General Drouot: Antoine Drouot (1774–1847), one of Napoléon’s most loyal generals, accompanied Napoléon to Elba and then on his return during the Hundred Days.

3. Napoléon’s proclamation: i.e., announcing his return from Elba and his intention to retake his imperial throne.

4. Juan Gulf: the site of Napoléon’s landing after his escape from Elba, roughly midway between Cannes and Nice.

5. General Bertrand … the good burghers: Général Comte Henri-Gatien Bertrand (1773–1844) may have proved himself Napoléon’s most loyal follower. Named grand marshal of the palace by the emperor in November 1813, Bertrand followed Napoléon not just to Elba but to post-Waterloo exile on Saint Helena, where he remained until Bonaparte’s death. He became one of the chief propagandists of the Napoleonic legend, and when King Louis-Philippe decided to bring Napoléon’s remains back to France in 1840, it was Bertrand who headed the mission. Hugo refers here to a legend by which Bertrand is said to have paved the way for Napoléon’s return to Paris by handing out honours (croix d’honneur, i.e., of the Legion of Honour) and money (“fistfuls of napoléons,” the name by which the twenty-franc “louis” was known under the Empire).

6. “twelve leagues”: thirty-six miles.

7. “Jean Valjean”: In the long genesis of his novel, Hugo changed the name of his hero several times, all versions based on the idea that the common name of Jean stood for an everyman: Jean Tréjean, John Veryjohn, a very ordinary man. The val- of Jean Valjean suggests “John is worth John,” or “John is as good as any other John.”

8. the wars of religion: At the end of the sixteenth century, clashes between Protestants and Catholics erupted into civil war, coming to a head when the Protestant King Henri IV inherited the throne from his cousin, Charles IX, last of the Valois dynasty. The wars ended when Henri converted to Catholicism, reasoning, according to legend, that Paris was well worth a mass.

9. “four sous”: twenty centimes (see here).

### 1.2.2: Prudence Is Recommended to Wisdom
1. Duty: i.e., le Devoir, the duty of Christians.

2. the Fathers and Doctors: the theologians, scholars, and philosophers recognized as authorities by the Catholic Church: Saint Augustine, Saint Jerome, Saint Thomas Aquinas, etc.

### 1.2.3: The Heroism of Passive Obedience
1. “Toulon”: a large Mediterranean port that was the site of shipyards where prisoners given sentences to forced labour (forçats) were imprisoned.

2. “my yellow passport”: Passports were required for internal travel in France at the time; Jean Valjean’s passport marks him as a convict even though he has served his sentence.

3. “bishop of the Majore, in Marseilles”: Sainte-Marie-la-Majeure, known as La Majore, is the cathedral of Marseilles, rebuilt in the 1850s.

4. “a pointed thing, gold, on his head”: the ceremonial bishop’s mitre.

5. a man shipwrecked on the Medusa: a famous shipwreck in 1814, memorialized in one of the most famous paintings of the era (see here).

6. “The red paletot”: the garment worn by prisoners at Toulon. Hugo noted all the details of prison life Jean Valjean describes in a visit to Toulon in 1839.

### 1.2.6: Jean Valjean
1. Brie: the agricultural region east and southeast of Paris.

2. Vlajean … “voilà Jean”: Jean Vlajean was one of the names Hugo considered for his hero. There is, in voilà Jean, “Behold Jean,” an echo of Pilate’s presentation of Christ to the crowd in Jerusalem: Ecce homo, “Behold the man” (John 19:5).

3. twenty-four sous a day: one franc, twenty centimes per day; the pay for this skilled labour is the most Jean Valjean earns in a year before taking his unskilled jobs out of season.

4. Montenotte: April 12, 1796, an early victory over the Austrians for the twenty-seven-year-old general still known, and still referring to himself, as Buonaparte, as seen below.

5. from the Directoire to the Five Hundred: The Directoire was the executive body that gave the government its name, the Council of the Five Hundred was the larger and more powerful chamber of the bicameral legislature.

6. Floréal 2, Year IV: the date according to the Revolutionary calendar, which counted from the fall of the monarchy in 1792.

7. Bicêtre prison: a notorious prison in Paris, where prisoners bound for Toulon were shackled together for the journey. Hugo described the process in detail in The Last Day of a Condemned Man.

8. Saint-Sulpice: a seventeenth-century church in today’s sixth arrondissement, near the Luxembourg gardens. Hugo lived nearby with his mother and brothers after his parents’ separation.

9. Claude Gueux: a real-life prisoner who was put to death for attacking a prison guard; he was the subject of Hugo’s short 1834 book Claude Gueux.

### 1.2.7: Despair from the Inside
1. Ignorantine friars: an order founded with the mission of providing free education to poor children.

2. galley slave: The first prisoners sent to Toulon in the sixteenth century were in fact galley slaves, sentenced to work the oars of galley ships; the terms galérien and galères were still used long after sails had replaced oars and prisoners worked in the shipyards rather than on ships. Official use of the term forçat, for one sentenced to forced labour, began in the late eighteenth century.

3. rue Montorgueil near Les Halles: The former marketplace of Paris, the working-class neighbourhood around Les Halles will play an important role later in the novel.

4. one of Puget’s wonderful caryatids: The caryatids of sculptor Pierre-Henri Puget (1624–90) can still be seen on the façade of Toulon’s town hall.

### 1.2.9: Fresh Grievances
1. in Grasse … a distillery: Then as now, the Provençal city of Grasse was a centre of the perfume industry.

### 1.2.13: Petit-Gervais
1. Savoyard: i.e., a boy from the Kingdom of Savoy, made up of territory now found in northern Italy and southeastern France, including the cities of Torino and Chambéry. Petits Savoyards traditionally worked as chimney sweeps.

## Book 3: In the Year 1817
### 1.3.1: The Year 1817
1. the twenty-second year of his reign: Louis XVIII insisted that his reign dated from the death of Louis XVII in the Temple prison in 1795 (see here). This was a point of contention between the royalists and those who warily accepted his and his family’s return to a royal throne. <br/> This chapter was added to the novel during the revisions of 1860. There are a few inaccuracies in this long list of Hugo’s memories of Restoration Paris, and Hugo sometimes seems to be amusing himself with ironic depictions of people or events as he seeks to conjure up the political and cultural atmosphere of Restoration Paris for his Second Empire readers. <br/> Several critics have pointed out that 1817 is also the year in which Victor Hugo entered several public poetry competitions, thus marking his debut as a professional writer.

2. Monsieur Bruguière de Sorsum: (1773–1823) a minor poet and translator of Shakespeare.

3. azure and fleurs-de-lis: the traditional banner of the French kings.

4. the comte Lynch: As Hugo describes, Jean-Baptiste Lynch was the first government official to welcome the Bourbons, in the person of the duc d’Angoulême (see following note), back to France, several days before Napoléon’s abdication. Lynch had been in contact with royalist agents for some months as the imperial government steadily weakened. He was later rewarded with a title and a seat in the Chamber of Peers (see here).

5. Monsieur le duc d’Angoulême: Louis de France, the elder son (1755–1844) of the comte d’Artois, the future Charles X, second in line to the throne after the childless Louis XVIII and his father.

6. Napoléon was on Saint Helena … having his old riding habits turned: Bonaparte’s British jailers on the island of Saint Helena refused even the smallest gesture that would acknowledge their prisoner’s former status, including providing cloth in the colour that had been his imperial livery. Their stubbornness was matched by Bonaparte’s, who went to great lengths before giving in.

7. Pellegrini sang … Odry did not yet exist: The Italian singer Pellegrini actually made his Parisian debut in 1819; Potier and Odry were well-known comic actors during the Restoration.

8. Madame Saqui … Forioso: two famous tightrope walkers.

9. There were still Prussians in France: as well as Austrian, Russian, and British soldiers, who made up the occupying armies who remained in France until 1819.

10. Monsieur Delalot: the royalist editor of the Journal des débats, one of the most important newspapers of the nineteenth century. The royalist influence of Delalot was an exception to the publication’s long liberal tradition.

11. legitimacy: The doctrine adopted by the great European powers at the Congress of Vienna, legitimacy sought to restore a pre-Napoleonic, pre-Revolutionary status quo by replacing royal families on thrones usurped by Napoléon, his family, and his allies. Wellington and Metternich were the great symbols of legitimacy in the first half of the nineteenth century.

12. Pleignier, Carbonneau, and Tolleron: three men convicted of plotting to blow up the Tuileries Palace in 1816; subsequently executed. The ritual of cutting off their hands was part of the punishment prescribed for lèse-majesté.

13. The prince de Talleyrand … Louis serving him as deacon: Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord (1754–1838) was one of the legendary figures of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras; a great aristocrat, a one time bishop, a revolutionary politician, and above all a political survivor, Talleyrand served virtually every government from the Constituent Assembly through the July Monarchy, reaching the peak of his influence as foreign minister of France, first to Napoléon and then, having helped orchestrate the emperor’s downfall, to Louis XVIII. The Congress of Vienna was a triumph for Talleyrand before Napoléon’s return from Elba cost him his standing with the allies. On July 14, 1790, as bishop of Autun and one of the leading members of the Constituent Assembly, Talleyrand had officiated at a mass of celebration dedicated to the Federation of French citizens and their volunteer militias performed on the Champ de Mars. He was assisted in that mass by a priest named Abbé Joseph Louis (1755–1837). Thanks largely to Talleyrand’s protection, the abbé Louis, more interested in economics than theology, had a long career in government, serving as minister of finance under the Restoration and later for Louis-Philippe.

14. the Champ de Mai: On June 1, 1815, as allied armies massed in Belgium, Napoléon sought to rally Parisians to his cause with a grandiose pageant celebrating French military history from the Merovingian era—when military assemblies were known as champs de mai—to his own pre-Russian victories. The “eagles and bees” that decorated the gold-leafed wooden columns were the imperial symbols. During the post-Waterloo occupation, allied armies camped in bivouacs on the Champ de Mars and the Champs-Élysées and in the Boulogne and Vincennes woods.

15. Gros Caillou: a neighbourhood just to the east of the Champ de Mars.

16. the Touquet edition of Voltaire: That particular edition of Voltaire in fact appeared in 1821; the entrepreneurial publisher also marketed a “snuffbox à la Charte” with the text of the 1814 Constitution engraved on its lid.

17. the murder committed by Dautun: Charles Dautun murdered his brother in 1814 and was beheaded for it in 1816.

18. the Medusa: The frigate Medusa sank in 1816, a wreck made famous by the scandal of the ship’s captain, Chaumareix, fleeing first, and more so by the painting by Géricault, Le Radeau de la Méduse (The Raft of the Medusa), which dramatically depicts survivors clinging to a raft as a rescue ship, the Argus, approaches in the distance. It was one of the most famous paintings of the era.

19. Colonel Selves: A French officer whose name in fact was Sèves; in 1816, he travelled to Egypt, where he converted to Islam and entered the military under the name Suleiman Pasha.

20. Messier: Charles Messier (1730–1817) was the naval astronomer who worked on the roof of the Hôtel de Cluny, on the left bank, since restored and established as a museum of medieval history.

21. The duchesse de Duras: Claire de Kersaint (1778–1829), Duchesse de Duras, known as a bit of a bluestocking, received visitors, most notably Chateaubriand, in her small salon in the Abbaye-aux-Bois, boulevard Raspail. Her novel Ourika is the story of an African girl raised as the companion to the daughter of French aristocrats and of her unhappy romance with a young French nobleman. Ourika was in fact written in 1820 and published in 1824.

22. The Ns … the Louvre: Napoléon had had large Ns carved into the walls of the Louvre; they were replaced by double Ls.

23. The pont d’Austerlitz … Jardin du Roi: a neighbourhood on what was then the western edge of Paris took its name from Napoléon’s great victory of 1805; the Jardin du Roi, today known as the Jardin des Plantes, is in the same neigh-bourhood. Not all such Napoleonic memories were erased from Paris.

24. Louis XVIII … Mathurin Bruneau: Louis XVIII was the most learned of the three brothers who were the last Bourbon kings of France and knew Horace and other classical authors well. Even with Napoléon on Saint Helena, his partisans and his popularity were real concerns. Mathurin Bruneau (1784–?) was the con man son of a clogmaker (sabotier), who, after having impersonated a nobleman and royal cousin named Charles de Navarre, declared himself to be the long-lost dauphin of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette and thus the rightful king of France. He was soon arrested and imprisoned for vagrancy and fraud.

25. The Académie Française … essay prize: The fifteen-year-old Hugo submitted an ode to this competition.

26. Monsieur Bellart … Courier’s sarcasm: Nicolas Bellart (1761–1825) served as procureur général of Paris under the Restoration. One of his deputies, Jacques-Nicolas de Broë, would in 1821 attempt a legal prosecution of the liberal, anticlerical pamphleteer Paul-Louis Courier (1782–1825).

27. A Chateaubriand impersonator named Marchangy … d’Arlincourt: François-René, Vicomte de Chateaubriand (1768–1848), one of the most influential writers and politicians of the early nineteenth century. His short novel René was one of the first and most important texts of French Romanticism. He was also a leading politician, ambassador, and advocate of moderately conservative, constitutional monarchism. Chateaubriand was much admired by the young royalist Victor Hugo, who declared when he began writing poetry at age fourteen, “I want to be Chateaubriand or nothing.” When the two finally met in 1820, Chateaubriand called Hugo “l’enfant sublime” but, according to legend, did not like him. Louis-Antoine Marchangy and the vicomte d’Arlincourt aspired, and failed, to replicate Chateaubriand’s succes in literature and politics.

28. Claire d’Albe and Malek-Adel … Madame Cottin: Madame Cottin was a successful but largely forgotten popular novelist. Malek-Adel was also the name of a character in her novel Mathilde.

29. The Institut de France … Napoléon Bonaparte: The Revolutionary government had created the Institut de France in 1795 to replace the academies of the ancien régime; Napoléon Bonaparte had been invited to join the institute, ostensibly in recognition of his contribution to scholarship through the Egyptian expedition of 1798–99.

30. a naval school at Angoulême: The landlocked town of Angoulême is some distance from the ocean.

31. Franconi’s posters: In the 1780s, the Italian-born Antonio Franconi (1737–1836) started a successful circus in Paris, which was carried on by his sons.

32. Monsieur Paër … Edmond Géraud: Ferdinand Paër (1771–1839) and Edmond Géraud (1775–1821) were moderately successful composers during the early years of the Restoration.

33. The Nain jaune turned into the Miroir: The Nain jaune (Yellow Dwarf) was a satiric newspaper published from 1814 to 1815; also satiric, the Miroir, which appeared from 1821 to 1823, was not directly related to the Nain jaune.

34. The Café Lemblin … Café Valois: two cafés in the Palais-Royal where politically like-minded habitués would gather—former officers of the Grande Armée at Lemblin’s, aging returned émigrés at the Café Valois.

35. Monsieur le duc de Berry … Louvel: The duc de Berry was the younger son of the comte d’Artois. As the duchesse d’Angoulême, the wife of his elder brother and daughter of Louis XVI, was past childbearing age, the younger prince’s marriage was a matter of state concern. He was married to his distant cousin Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Sicile, daughter of the king of Naples and Sicily. The duc de Berry was assassinated at the Opéra by Louvel in 1820; the fact that his young wife was pregnant was taken by royalists as a sign of divine favour for the Bourbon monarchy.

36. Madame de Staël: Germaine Necker, Baronesse de Stäel-Holstein, was one of the most famous and influential women of the Revolutionary era; she died on July 14, 1817. Rich, ambitious, and well connected, she made her salon a centre of anti-Bonapartist opinion; the First Consul ordered her exile from France in 1803. Her books De l’Allemagne and Dix Années d’exil were critiques of his autocratic, unconstitutional government. She is best remembered today for her romantic fiction, especially the novels Corinne and Delphine.

37. Mademoiselle Mars: Jeanne-Marguerite Salvetat (1779–1847), known as Mademoiselle Mars, was the leading actress of the Comédie-Française from 1803 on. Mademoiselle Mars was Napoléon’s favourite actress and briefly his mistress. Later in her career, she would play Doña Sol in Hugo’s Hernani (1830). (see here).

38. The Constitutionnel was constitutional: i.e., liberal.

39. The Minerve: was in fact first published in 1818.

40. the turncoat press … the outlaws of 1815: One of the “outlaws of 1815” was General Léopold Hugo, who held the fortified city of Thionville for months after Napoléon’s abdication.

41. David had lost his talent … lost his genius: The painter Jacques-Louis David (1748–1825) had joined the Revolutionary cause with fervour, become an ally of Robespierre, and voted for the execution of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette as a member of the Convention, before finally ingratiating himself to Napoléon. He was exiled in 1816. The playwright Antoine-Vincent Arnault (1766–1834) was a fervent and very public supporter of Napoléon during the Hundred Days; the premiere of his play Germanicus in 1817 was highly politicized. Lazare Carnot (1753–1823) was famous for his integrity and his republican convictions; having rallied to Napoléon during the Hundred Days, he was banished by the Bourbons. Nicolas-Jean de Dieu Soult (1769–1851) was named marshal of France and duc de Dalmatie by Napoléon; minister of war during the Hundred Days, he was exiled from 1815 to 1819, and eventually enjoyed a successful political career under Louis-Philippe.

42. Everyone knows that letters … rarely reach him: It is worth recalling here that Hugo wrote this chapter while in exile himself.

43. Descartes … banished: The philosopher René Descartes (1596–1650) settled in Holland in 1629, seeking to avoid the interference of the Church, but of his own volition, not due to a legal banishment. He remained in Holland until 1649, when Queen Christina of Sweden invited him to her court at Stockholm, where he fell ill and died.

44. Whether you said “regicides” or “voters” … “Napoléon” or “Buonaparte”: The divide between the various political factions of post-Napoleonic France: republicans, revolutionaries, and Bonapartists on one side and royalists on the other: “regicides or voters” refers to those members of the Convention who voted for the death penalty for Louis XVI; “enemies or allies” to the occupying allied forces, who were viewed as allies by supporters of the Bourbons and as enemies of the nation to those, republicans and imperialists, who resented the return of the monarchy; to use Napoléon’s first name only was to implicitly recognize the Empire as legal and valid, while dismissing him as “Buonaparte” relegated him to the status of usurper and military adventurer, however successful.

45. All reasonable people agreed: Writing in 1860, Hugo looks back with some irony on the revolutions that followed 1817: 1830, 1848, and the coup d’état of 1851 that established the Second Empire of Napoléon III.

46. Redivivus … the statue of Henri IV: redivivus, Latin for “resurrected.” In 1818, the statue of Henri IV that had been removed by the Revolutionary government was replaced on its pedestal on the Île de la Cité. The adolescent Victor Hugo won a prize for an ode dedicated to the rechristened statue of the first Bourbon king of France. The statue was cast in bronze obtained by melting down the statue of Napoléon from the top of the Vendôme column.

47. Monsieur Pieté: The royalist deputy’s house in the rue Thérèse served as a meeting place for a large group of ultra-royalists called Ultras.

48. Bacot: The politician René Bacot was a Bonapartist turned Ultra. Hugo exaggerates his political influence.

49. The ultra-royalists … “Waterside Conspiracy”: An ephemeral conspiracy of Ultra extremists who met in the Tuileries Garden, along the bank of the Seine, to plan their fanciful kidnapping of Louis XVIII, whom they hoped to force to abdicate in favour of his more conservative brother, Monsieur the comte d’Artois. The degree of Artois’ complicity is doubtful, and the plotters were eventually released, but the minister of police, Decazes (see below), successfully used the plot to create a rift between the two brothers, thus strengthening his own position in the king’s circle.

50. The ex-army officers … Trogoff: L’Épingle Noire (The Black Needle) was a secret group of Bonapartist officers who began meeting in 1817. In 1820, several members, including Delaverderie and Trogoff, were charged with plotting against the government.

51. Monsieur Decazes … prevailed: Élie Decazes (1780–1860), an ambitious bureaucrat who became the favourite of Louis XVIII; he was viewed with great hostility by the Ultras, who managed to bring about his downfall following the assassination of the duc de Berry.

52. Chateaubriand … La Monarchie selon la Charte: As a conservative constitutional monarchist, Chateaubriand was viewed with hostility by the Ultras to his right and the liberals to his left. La Monarchie selon la Charte had in fact been published in 1816.

53. preferred Lafon to Talma: an allusion to the failings of critics, as Talma (François-Joseph Talma, but always referred to by only one name; 1763–1826) was generally recognized as the greatest actor of his time, while Lafon was largely forgotten by 1860.

54. Monsieur de Féletz … Monsieur Hoffmann: Féletz and Hoffmann were literary critics. Hoffmann wrote a negative review of Hugo’s first published collection of verse in 1822.

55. Charles Nodier: One of the leading figures of early French Romanticism, Nodier acted as a patron to the youthful poet Hugo in the 1820s.

56. Divorce was abolished: Divorce had been legalized under the First Republic and continued to be legal, if rare, under the empire; it was outlawed again under the Bourbon Restoration. Hugo’s parents had begun divorce proceedings in 1814, but the return of the Bourbons meant that they remained married until Madame Hugo’s death in 1821.

57. the king of Rome: the son of Napoléon and Marie-Louise von Hapsburg; recognized as Napoléon II by loyal Bonapartists, he was known as the duke of Neipperg in Austria. He lived at Schönbrunn, his grandfather’s palace outside Vienna, and died there of tuberculosis in 1832, at the age of twenty-one.

58. Madame: Marie-Thérèse de Bourbon (1778–1851), daughter of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette; wife of her cousin the duc d’Angoulême. Known as the Orphan of the Temple (l’Orphéline du Temple), she had seen first her father, then her mother taken away to the guillotine and her brother taken away to be raised as a ward of the Republic, before she was sent to her Austrian relatives in return for French prisoners of war in 1795, at the age of seventeen. Known as Madame Royale, she was held in quasi-religious veneration by royalists and quietly pressured her uncle Louis XVIII to rid the government of the Revolutionary survivors she regarded as her parents’ murderers.

59. Monsieur le duc d’Orléans: Louis-Philippe de Bourbon-Orléans (1773–1850), cousin of the royal family and first prince of the blood royal (premier prince du sang). The duke’s popularity was doubly troubling to the royal family, as his family had been considered an alternative to the elder branch of the Bourbons since the 1790s, especially in 1814 and again in 1815. For Madame Royale, the duke’s popularity was especially disturbing since his father had embraced the Revolution, renouncing his title and calling himself Philippe-Égalité. The renegade duke had been elected to the Convention and voted for his cousin’s execution before being arrested and beheaded himself. Louis-Philippe would in fact take the throne from Charles X after the July Revolution of 1830.

60. the dome of the Invalides: The Hôtel des Invalides was built as a hospital and convalescent home for wounded soldiers by Louis XIV, including a church with a dome covered in gold leaf.

61. Monsieur de Trinquelague … Monsieur de Salaberry was not happy: conservative politicians of middling importance. Clausel de Montals was a politically conservative priest who used his sermons and writings to promote the same legitimist politics as did his brother, the Ultra deputy Clausel de Coussergues.

62. Picard: Molière was an actor as well as a playwright. In spite of the Académie’s opinions, Picard was already largely forgotten in 1862.

63. the Odéon: The changing names of this theatre, founded in 1782, reflect the dramatic changes in French politics.

64. Cugnet de Montarlot: a Napoleonic officer prosecuted for his membership in the secret society Le Lion Dormant (The Sleeping Lion); he was acquitted, along with his codefendants.

65. Fabvier … Bavoux: Charles-Nicolas Fabvier (1782–1855) was a member of the Épingle Noire (see here). Banished in 1820, he made his way to Athens, where he served as a general in the Greek insurgency against the Turks. He returned to France after the July Revolution and was named a lieutenant general and a peer. Like Hugo, he served in the Legislative Assembly of the Second Republic and retired from politics on the declaration of the Second Empire. Nicolas Bavoux was a professor of law who used his classroom as a forum to passionately critique the Restoration government. Fired in 1819, he was subsequently prosecuted for sedition and acquitted.

66. Pélicier: Hugo seems to have invented this minor act of commercial fraud by Pélicier, the publisher of Hugo’s first poetry collection, Odes et poésies diverses (1822), with whom he later had a falling-out.

67. Monsieur Charles Loyson: After having taken first prize in an 1817 poetry competition in which Hugo received only an honourable mention, Charles de Loyson died in 1820, at age twenty-nine.

68. Cardinal Fesch … the diocese of Lyon: Napoléon had named his uncle Joseph Fesch (see here) archbishop of Lyon, which seat the cardinal refused to officially resign even though he had been living in exile in Rome ever since his nephew’s final defeat. Monsieur de Pins would serve as de facto archbishop of Lyon until his death in 1837.

69. the valley of Dappes: The Swiss had ceded this valley in the Juras to Bonaparte in 1804, and the Congress of Vienna had returned it to Switzerland. The French government, however, resisted and did not officially give up control until 1863.

70. Saint-Simon: An indirect descendant of the seventeenth-century memorialist of the court of Louis XIV, the comte Henri de Saint-Simon (1760–1825) advocated social reform through industrialization and progressivism, guided by a sense of Christian fraternity. His work would inspire a utopian community after his death.

71. a celebrated Fourier … a Fourier the future will remember: The scientist Joseph Fourier (1768–1830) would in fact be eclipsed by the utopian socialist Charles Fourier (1772–1837), whose work would inspire the Phalanstery movement in the United States, most notably Brook Farm.

72. David d’Angers: Not to be confused with the painter Jacques-Louis David, the sculptor David d’Angers established his reputation with a statue commissioned by the government in 1816.

73. The abbé Caron … Lamennais: The abbé Caron had befriended and protected Félicité de Lamennais (1782–1854), who published the first part of his Essay on Indifference in Matters of Religion in 1817. The two priests were briefly neighbours of Madame Hugo and her sons, and Lamennais sought—unsuccessfully—to convert the teenage Victor to the orthodox Catholicism he was then preaching. Lamennais stressed (among other things) the social value of the Christian religion. Lamennais later became a champion of the poor and an advocate of republicanism.

74. Monsieur de Vaublanc: The comte de Vaublanc (1756–1845), as minister of the interior to Louis XVIII, had effective control of the Institut de France, including nominations to the Académie Française.

75. The faubourg Saint-Germain and the pavillon Marsan: The elegant faubourg Saint-Germain neighbourhood, corresponding roughly to today’s seventh arrondissement, was a metaphor for the ultra-royalist, ancien régime aristocrats who lived there. Those social and political conservatives placed their hopes in Louis XVIII’s brother, the comte d’Artois, who would become Charles X in 1824 and who resided in a wing of the Tuileries palace known as the pavillon Marsan.

76. Monsieur Delavau: It is typical of the Ultras that religious devotion should be the chief qualification for political office; minister of police was the office held by Decazes, whom the Ultras held responsible for Louis XVIII’s supposed liberalism. Delavau was named to head the police when the conservative Villèle (see here) replaced Decazes in 1821.

77. Dupuytren and Récamier: Both Guillaume Dupuytren (1777–1835) and Joseph-Claude Récamier (1774–1852) were famous surgeons, but Récamier was a devout Christian, while Dupuytren was reputed to be an atheist.

78. Cuvier: Georges Cuvier (1769–1832), a naturalist whose studies of fossils made him one of the founders of modern biology and paleontology.

79. bigots: in the French sense of the term, persons of inflexible religious orthodoxy.

80. François de Neufchâteau … Parmentier’s memory: Nicolas-Louis François de Neufchâteau (1750–1828) had briefly served as minister of the interior and was an amateur agronomist and sometime poet. He had championed the cause of Antoine-Augustin Parmentier (1737–1813), the agronomist who had popularized the cultivation of the potato in France long after it had spread through Europe. As a member of the Académie Française, Neufchâteau had taken an interest—albeit a self-centred one—in the young poet Victor Hugo (see here).

81. The abbé Grégoire: The abbé Grégoire (see here) was denounced by royalists as a regicide, even though he had been absent from the Convention on the day of the vote.

82. Monsieur Royer-Collard: Pierre-Paul Royer-Collard (1763–1845), a scholar and politician; as a moderate constitutional monarchist, Royer-Collard was prepared to accept innovation in politics but not in the French language.

83. the pont d’Iéna: named after Napoléon’s victory over the Prussians at Jena. The occupying Prussians had planned to blow up the bridge in a bid to reclaim their national pride; after Blücher’s initial attempt failed, Louis XVIII sent word to the duke of Wellington, the chief of the Allied forces, that he intended to have his carriage driven to the middle of the bridge, ready to go up with the bridge, if Blücher followed through with his plans. Wellington reined the Prussians in. Louis understood the importance of such symbolism in maintaining the support of the army for his new government.

84. Blücher: Gebhard Leberecht Blücher, Prince von Wahlstatt (1742–1819), the commander of the Prussian forces in the 1815 coalition. His arrival at Waterloo decisively turned the battle against the French. An aggressive soldier, he was known by his troops as “Vorwärts!” (Forward!).

85. the comte d’Artois: the ultra-royalist Charles-Philippe de Bourbon, the youngest brother of Louis XVI and Louis XVIII, known as Monsieur under the Restoration; his attempts to turn back the political clock after his accession to the throne as Charles X, in 1824, would eventually provoke the July Revolution of 1830. Charles died in exile in Prague in 1836.

86. “Bonaparte and Talma … arm in arm”: Bonaparte was a great admirer of the actor Talma, who was rumoured to have coached the general turned politician in his public appearances. Their trips to the Bal-Sauvage, a public ball, must have been early in Bonaparte’s career, as he became increasingly conscious of his public image as his power increased through the Consulate and Empire.

87. the deserters of Ligny and Quatre-Bras: On June 16, 1815, two days before Waterloo, Napoléon planned an offensive against the divided Allied armies. He would attack the Prussians under Blücher at Ligny, while Ney would attack the Anglo-Dutch forces at Quatre-Bras. Napoléon successfully pushed back the Germans, but Ney’s relative inaction did no damage to Wellington’s forces. Blücher managed to preserve his cavalry, which arrived at Waterloo just in time to decisively turn the battle in the Allies’ favour. The word deserters conveys Hugo’s still-strong emotions about the Napoleonic era, some fifty years after the fact.

### 1.3.2: A Double Foursome
1. to study in Paris … born in Paris: Hugo himself was born in Besançon but studied in Paris.

2. “Oscar”: Here, and in the following paragraphs, Hugo mocks the early Romantic literature, chiefly influenced by Sir Walter Scott in “Scandinavian or Caledonian” (i.e., Scottish) settings with heroes named Oscar, Adolph, Gustave, etc. Adolphe was a popular autobiographically inspired novel (1816) by Benjamin Constant, inspired by his own affair with Madame de Stäel (Corinne, 1807, gives her side of the story). Hugo’s own novel Han d’Islande betrays some of the same influences.

3. Ossian: a collection of poems published in London in the early 1760s by James Macpherson, a Scotsman who claimed to have discovered and translated the epic story of “Ossian” from the original Scots Gaelic. Before Macpherson’s poems were discovered to be his own invention, they enjoyed a huge success all over Europe. Napoléon and Chateaubriand were great admirers of the Ossianic saga.

4. Favourite, so named because she had been to England: favourite being a term used to describe a royal mistress.

5. nom de guerre: A classic trope of the nineteenth-century demimonde is the single name adopted by the courtesan.

6. Jungfrau: The German word Jungfrau means “maiden” or “virgin.” The exact reference here is unclear.

7. Gascon: The Pyrenean province of Gascony, in southwestern France, was said to produce proud, boastful people. Edmond Rostand’s Cyrano de Bergerac is based on the traditional stereotype.

8. the Directoire: In the chaotic 1790s, it is not difficult to imagine a child born in the circumstances Hugo creates for Fantine.

9. working girls: not quite courtesans, “working girls,” or grisettes, refers to young working-class women—seamstresses, shopgirls, laundresses—who were the mistresses of students, struggling artists, and young men of their own class. They provided young men company in cheap restaurants, the parterres of theatres, and the public balls of Montmartre and the suburbs. In nineteenth-century Paris, especially in its literary representations, the grisette occupies a place above the common prostitute but below the dancers, actresses, and grand courtesans of the demimonde.

10. four thousand francs annual income: not a princely sum, but a substantial income for a student, even a thirty-year-old student. Compare to the twenty-four sous a day Jean Valjean earns for his manual labour, less than five hundred francs a year.

11. the montagne Sainte-Geneviève: the hill rising up on the left bank of the Seine, topped by the Panthéon. It is used here as a synonym for the Latin Quarter, home of the Sorbonne and its students.

12. “the noggin at thirty, the knees at forty”: i.e., “When the hair goes by thirty, the knees go by forty.” Already wrinkled and losing his teeth, Tholomyès is philosophical about his precocious old age.

### 1.3.3: Four by Four
1. today we say Fécamp … Saint-Cloud: Fécamp is a small Norman town on the coast of the English Channel; Saint-Cloud, on the western outskirts of Paris, was the site of a royal château with magnificent gardens and park including an elaborate man-made cascade or waterfall. Saint-Cloud was the preferred residence of Marie Antoinette and the Bonapartes. The park was open to the public provided they were decently dressed. The château was demolished after sustaining heavy damage during the siege of Paris in 1870, but the park remains.

2. folies champêtres: i.e., pastoral amusements, a romantic image of innocent youth at play in the fields.

3. Castaing: Dr. Castaing was executed in 1823 for poisoning two of his best friends in order to inherit their estates.

4. Puteaux … Neuilly: The four couples’ day in the country takes them on a tour of the western suburbs of Paris, some of which, such as Passy, are now part of Paris itself.

5. the knight of Labouïsse: Known as the poète de l’hymène, Jean-Pierre de Labouïsse-Rochefort was especially well-known for the poetry he dedicated to his wife, Eléanore.

6. Delvincourt and Monsieur Blondeau: two professors of law at the University of Paris. Étienne-Claude Delvincourt (1762–1831) was the dean of the law school and a royalist; Jean-Hyacinthe Blondeau (1784–1854) was a specialist in Roman law.

7. Galatea’s flight beneath the willows: not Pygmalion’s Galatea but a reference to Virgil’s Eclogues, in which the flirtatious nymph Galatea tempts a young shepherd to abandon his flock and follow her into the woods.

8. Erigone: The lover of the wine god Bacchus, Erigone took the form of a bunch of grapes to seduce him.

9. Canebière: a wide street that runs through the “Old Marseilles” section of the city, down to the port.

10. the vicomtesse de Cette: perhaps a reference to Ermengarde de Narbonne, a twelfth-century noblewoman who is said to have maintained a “court of love.”

11. Coustou: Nicolas Coustou (1658–1733), a sculptor.

12. Psyche and Venus: Psyche, though so beautiful she caused the goddess Venus to be jealous, was a mere mortal.

### 1.3.4: Tholomyès Is So Cheery He Sings a Spanish Ditty
1. “The embarkation for Cythera!” cries Watteau … for good measure: Antoine Watteau (1684–1721) was the great painter of the fête galante; The Embarkation for Cythera is one of his most famous paintings. Nicolas Lancret (1690–1743) was a less successful imitator of Watteau. For Diderot, see here. Honoré d’Urfé’s novel Astrée is set in fifth-century Gaul, complete with Druids.

2. the Bien National: or national property; the term bien national originated with the Revolution, when the estates and properties of émigrés and others judged guilty of political crimes were confiscated and, when possible, sold to provide revenue to the government.

3. Bourguin: Those who had supply contracts with Napoléon’s armies often made fortunes in dubious dealings and inflated prices. Such characters are staples of literature of the era, especially Balzac’s Comédie humaine.

4. the anchorite: i.e., a hermit.

5. a Turcaret metamorphosed into Priapus: Turcaret was the title character of a 1709 play by Alain-René Lesage, a sharply satirical portrait of a greedy financier. Priapus was the Roman god of male fertility and a symbol of lust.

6. the abbé de Bernis: A fixture of the court of Louis XV, the poet-priest Bernis was the protégé of both the duc de Choiseul, Louis’s powerful minister, and the marquise de Pompadour, his even more powerful mistress. His poems often described romantic pastoral scenes such as two peasant lovers and a “swing that hung from two chestnuts.”

7. Greuze: Jean-Baptiste Greuze (1725–1804), one of the most popular painters of the late eighteenth century.

8. the old gallega song: “Soy de Badajoz. / Amor me llama. / Toda mi alma / Es en mis ojos / Porque enseñas / A tus piernas.”

9. from Passy to the barrière de l’Étoile: Then a leafy suburb, Passy is now part of the sixteenth arrondissement of Paris; the barrière de l’Étoile is now the place de l’Étoile.

10. Beaujon heights: On a rise north of the Champs-Élysées, on the site of the estate of the banker Nicolas Beaujon, a sort of amusement park had been built in the late eighteenth century, including a montagne russe, an early form of the roller coaster.

### 1.3.5: At Bombarda’s
1. Bombarda: a real restaurant of the Restoration era.

2. Molière: Born Jean-Baptiste Poquelin (1622), Molière created comedies and characters—the religious hypocrite Tartuffe, the misanthrope Alceste, Monsieur Jourdain of The Would-be Gentleman—who are frequent points of reference for Hugo and his readers. The verse quoted here is from L’Étourdi (The Blunderer). Molière, Racine, and Corneille are considered to be the three greatest playwrights of the Golden Age under Louis XIV.

3. Their feet … were able: “Ils faisaient sous la table / Un bruit, un trique-trac de pieds epouvantable.”

4. The Marly horses: The Marly horses, originally sculpted by Guillaume Coustou for the gardens of the royal château Marly, were moved to the Champs-Élysées during the Revolution.

5. the white flag … Tuileries: the royal flag indicating that the king was in residence.

6. The place de la Concorde … place Louis XV: The place Louis XV was re-baptized place de la Révolution by the Convention in 1792, then place de la Concorde after the fall of Robespierre; it reverted to its Bourbon name in 1815, and back to the place de la Concorde in 1830.

7. the silver fleur-de-lis … not yet disappeared: i.e., the Bourbons were still fairly popular.

8. the Hundred Days: les Cent Jours, the name given to Napoléon’s 1815 return to power.

9. our Père de Gand: Louis XVIII fled to Ghent (Gand in French), Belgium, as Napoléon approached Paris after his escape from Elba.

10. Give us back … our Father: “Rendez-nous notre père de Gand, / Rendeznous notre père.”

11. faubourg folk … good bourgeois: Faubourgs (suburbs) were home to the working and artisan classes, as opposed to the more affluent—and respectably royalist—bourgeois who could afford to live in Paris.

12. the great carré Marigny: a square roughly in the middle of the Champs-Élysées.

13. the prefect of police, Anglès: Jules Anglès (1778–1828) held that office from 1815 until 1821. His name will appear frequently through the first part of the novel. He was succeeded by Guy Delavau (see here).

14. Minerva: the Roman name for Athena, goddess of wisdom.

15. the tenth of August: the final fall of Louis XVI in 1792, when Parisian crowds invaded the Tuileries palace and forced the royal family to ask for the protection of the National Assembly, effectively an abdication by the king.

16. Austerlitz: Napoléon’s first great military victory as emperor; see here.

17. Danton’s mainstay: The great Revolutionary orator Georges-Jacques Danton (1759–94), known as the Mirabeau du peuple, was immensely popular with the Parisian working classes. Danton became Robespierre’s great rival for power in the Convention. He was guillotined in April 1794, only a few months before Robespierre’s fall.

18. turn the first rue Greneta … into the Caudine Forks: The rue Greneta, in the district of Les Halles, was the site of a popular insurrection in 1839; the Caudine Forks are a narrow mountain gorge in southern Italy where the Roman army was trapped and defeated by the Samnites in the fourth century B.C.E. “To pass through the Caudine Forks” is a proverbial expression in France, meaning to go through an almost impossible situation.

19. the “Carmagnole”: a popular song of the French Revolution, its lyrics directly threatened Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. The “Marseillaise,” which became the French national anthem, began as a marching song for Revolutionary armies, its lyrics more broadly denouncing tyranny.

### 1.3.6: A Chapter Where Everyone Adores One Another
1. Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas: a parish church on the southern edge of the Latin Quarter, in the rue Saint-Jacques.

### 1.3.7: The Wisdom of Tholomyès
1. “Grimod de la Reynière … Talleyrand”: Alexandre Grimod de la Reynière advocated “the pleasures of the table” under the Restoration. Talleyrand, the post-Revolutionary grand seigneur, cultivated an image of aristocratic desinvoltura; he was said to have frequently admonished his underlings to show no zeal (“Pas de zèle!”) in their diplomatic communications.

2. “Jesus Christ made a pun … city of Toryna”: a reference to Matthew 16:18, “You are Peter and on this rock I shall build my Church.” Moses’ pun about Isaac—according to a tradition by which Moses was the author of the book of Genesis—is that Isaac means “he who laughs,” because Abraham laughed when God told him that he would have a son when he was a hundred years old and his wife was ninety-three. The playwright Aeschylus pointed out that Polynices, whose name means “many victories” or “many quarrels,” fought many battles. Cleopatra’s pun about Octavius does not translate well, but the sense of it, that Octavius was no warrior but an ineffectual political schemer, was rendered moot when Octavius’s forces defeated those of Cleopatra and Mark Antony at Actium, near the city of Toryna.

3. “the prudence of Amphiaraüs”: a Greek warrior given the gift of prophecy by the gods; he went into battle against Thebes in spite of having foreseen his own death.

4. “Est modus in rebus”: from Horace, roughly, “In all things, moderation.”

5. “Gula punishes Gulax”: i.e., gluttony is its own punishment.

6. “Munatius Demens … quaestor of parricide”: “Parricide” may be a reference to Nero, i.e., Munatius Demens, whose name suggests dementia, madness, is the judge (quatator) who metes out justice in the name of a murderer.

7. “Sulla or Origen of Alexandria”: Sulla was a second-century-B.C.E. Roman general and dictator who abdicated his political power; Origen of Alexandria, one of the Fathers of the Church, believed so strongly in the renunciation of earthly pleasures that he castrated himself.

8. “Prospero”: Félix is usually associated with the Latin, “happy.”

9. “Woman is perfidious and devious”: an echo of Hugo’s Le Roi s’amuse (The King Takes His Pleasure). According to legend, King Francis I scratched a verse along those lines [into a wooden window frame at Chambord: “Souvent femme varie / Bien fol qui s’y fie” (A woman is fickle / ’tis folly to trust her). Hugo used the phrase at a key point in his play. In Verdi’s Rigoletto, the verse becomes the Italian La donna è mobile.

10. “Nunc te, Bacche, canam!”: The citation from Virgil’s Eclogues, “And now, Bacchus, I shall sing of you!,” is not Spanish but Latin.

11. “handed the apple, like Venus”: According to the Greek myth, the Trojan War began when Paris was called upon to hand a golden apple to the most beautiful of the goddesses. When he chose Aphrodite (Venus), she gave him the love of Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world and the wife of the king of Sparta.

12. “to Liège for corks or to Pau for gloves”: The Belgian industrial town of Liège was known for its manufacture of gloves, among other things; corks came from the southwest of France, around the city of Pau.

13. “Marguerite”: Hugo had briefly thought of naming this character Marguerite, which is derived from the Greek word for “pearl.”

14. “Clermont-Tonnerre”: The Clermont-Tonnerre family was one of the greatest of the French aristocracy. The historically minded students seem to be alluding to some medieval scheme to win the papacy for one of them, which is not at all improbable.

15. The Father … money back: “Les pères dindons donnèrent / De l’argent à un agent / Pour que mons Clermont-Tonnerre / Fût fait pape à la Saint-Jean; / Mais Clermont ne put pas être / Fait pape, n’étant pas prêtre; / Alors leur agent rageant / Leur rapporta leur argent.”

16. “Elleviou”: François Elleviou (1769–1842) was a famous singer at the Parisian theatres Comédie Italienne and Opéra-Comique.

17. “O Luxembourg … allée de l’Observatoire”: The Parisian Tholomyès sings the glories of what nature is to be found in Paris, from the Luxembourg gardens to the allée de l’Observatoire and the rue Madame, which run alongside them. Like his Eclogues, Virgil’s Georgics celebrate the rural life.

### 1.3.8: Death of a Horse
1. “Edon’s”: another real restaurant of Restoration Paris, one that Hugo had frequented with his brothers as a boy.

2. “glaces”: The French word glace refers to both ice cream and decorative mirrors.

3. “Descartes or Spinoza”: For Descartes, see here; Baruch Spinoza (1632–77) was born in Holland of Portuguese-Jewish parents. His rationalist philosophy is often seen as a precursor to the Enlightenment.

4. “Désaugiers”: a composer of popular songs.

5. “Ber— … Choux”: Arnaud Berquin (1747–91) wrote sentimental and moralistic books for children. Joseph de Berchoux (1760–1839) is best known for his long poem La Gastronomie (1801), which celebrated the pleasures of the table and good company.

6. “Munophis of Elephanta … Thygelion of Cheroneus”: these names seem to be inventions of Hugo.

7. “Apuleius”: a second-century Roman author.

8. “Nil sub sole novum”: Ecclesiastes 1:10.

9. “amor omnibus idem”: from the Georgics, the sense is that love is a tyrant for everyone.

10. “Aspasia … Samos”: Aspasia is a legendary figure said to have exerted enormous political influence over Pericles in fifth-century-B.C.E. Athens. She is variously described as being Pericles’ lover and his wife; others describe her as a prostitute and brothel keeper. One legend claims that Pericles declared war against Samos to gratify his mistress.

11. “Manon Lescaut”: the prostitute heroine of the abbé Prévost’s immensely popular 1733 novel.

12. “Prometheus”: the Titan who stole fire from the gods and gave it to mortals; as punishment, he was chained to a mountain, where vultures pecked at his liver for all eternity.

13. a mare from Beauce: The Beauce is a vast agricultural region south of Paris.

14. She was … the mongrel!: “Elle était de ce monde où coucous et carrosses / Ont le même destin; / Et, rosse, elle a vécu ce que vivent les rosses, / L’espace d’un matin!”

### 1.3.9: Happy Ending to Happiness
1. “The Toulouse diligence”: i.e., the public coach bound for Toulouse, in southwest France. The firm Laffitte et Caillard ran the diligence service from Paris to Toulouse and other routes.

## Book 4: To Entrust Is Sometimes to Abandon
### 1.4.1: One Mother Meets Another
1. Homer … Caliban: In Homer’s Odyssey, Polyphemus is the Cyclops who traps Odysseus and his sailors in his cave. Caliban, in Shakespeare’s Tempest, is the half-human slave of Prospero, who once tried to rape Prospero’s daughter, Miranda, and who rebels against his master.

2. King Louis-Philippe: Louis-Philippe d’Orléans (born 1773, reigned 1830 to 1848, died in exile in 1850) took the throne after the July 1830 Revolution. His eighteen-year reign was scorned by both the left and the right as la monarchie bourgeoise; many artists saw it as a triumph of crass middle-class materialism, nicely incarnated by Tholomyès as described here. In spite of his scorn, Hugo served in the Chamber of Peers under Louis-Philippe and was friendly with the king and his family.

3. Cosette … Euphrasie: One sees in these different but similar names the difference between the child’s father and mother. Euphrasie suggests the Greco-Latin roots of eu- (“good” or “well”) plus phras- (from the Greek verb for “to tell”), while Cosette suggests the French verb causer, to speak easily and informally.

### 1.4.2: Initial Sketch of Two Shady Characters
1. Clélie … Madame Barthélémy-Hadot: Hugo traces the decline of the novel from the seventeenth century to his own. Mademoiselle de Scudéri (usually Scudéry, 1607–1701) wrote enormously successful, metaphorical romances, such as Clélie, in the mode of the précieuses of the age; more widely read today is her contemporary Madame de La Fayette (1634–93), whose La Princesse de Clèves is considered the first psychological novel. In spite of the gentle scorn Hugo directs at Mesdames Bournon-Malarme and Barthélémy-Hadot, Yves Gohin notes that Hugo read their novels as a child and teenager. It is also worth noting that Hugo does not include such novelists as Stendhal, Balzac, or for that matter Madame de Stäel or George Sand. A very distinct type of popular, romantic novel is targeted here.

2. Pigault-Lebrun: see here.

3. Megaera … from Pamela: Megaera was one of the three Furies; the French word mégère translates roughly as “shrew.” Pamela was the heroine of Samuel Richardson’s 1740 novel of the same name, which was hugely successful in France and a frequent point of reference of French Romantic literature.

4. Éponine … Gulnare: “Éponine” was in fact the name of a Gaulish heroine who aided her husband, Sabinus, in his fight against the invading Romans (see here). “Gulnare” suggests the Scandinavian–New Caledonian influences as for Oscar and Alfred (see here).

5. Ducray-Duminil: François-Guillaume Ducray-Duminil (1761–1819), another popular novelist.

### 1.4.3: The Lark
1. a caution: i.e., a legal judgment marking him as a debtor.

## Book 5: The Descent
### 1.5.2: Madeleine
1. Madeleine: The religious overtones of the name, derived from Mary Magdalene’s, are unmistakable.

2. an Oratorian father named Fouché: Another of the legendary figures of the era, Joseph Fouché (1763–1820) made his name as a ruthless enforcer of Revolutionary politics and policies (including overseeing the execution of more than a thousand “counterrevolutionaries” in barely three months). He ruthlessly enforced official atheism under the Convention. This reputation and a talent for espionage made Fouché the powerful minister of police for the Directoire and most of the Napoleonic empire. During the Hundred Days, Fouché played the royalists against the imperialists until deciding to side with the Bourbons. The Bourbons’ gratitude to the regicide did not last, however, and Fouché died in Trieste in 1821 after five years of exile from France. Contrary to legend, Fouché was a lay teacher in an Oratorian school and never took holy orders.

3. the Moniteur: the official journal of government proceedings from 1795 to 1901.

4. chevalier of the Légion d’Honneur: Knight of the Legion of Honour; the Bourbons had retained the Napoleonic institution, cheapening it, in the eyes of true Bonapartists, by awarding it indiscriminately.

### 1.5.3: Sums Deposited with Laffitte
1. Laffitte: Jacques Laffitte (1767–1844) served as governor of the Banque de France under the Empire and personal banker to Napoléon; he sided with the liberal opposition under the Restoration and supported the advent of Louis-Philippe to the throne in 1830.

### 1.5.4: Monsieur Madeleine in Mourning
1. microscopic faubourg Saint-Germain: i.e., the local aristocracy (see here).

### 1.5.5: Dim Flashes of Lightning on the Horizon
1. a kind of Styx: In Greek mythology, the river Styx is one of the three rivers of the underworld.

2. Brutus meets Vidocq: Junius Brutus led a conspiracy of Roman senators to assassinate Julius Caesar out of a sense of duty to the Republic (Hugo’s father briefly took the name to demonstrate his Republican devotion). The legendary Eugène-François Vidocq (1775–1857), the “Napoléon de la police,” was a former convict who became a secret agent of the French police. The true details of Vidocq’s career are ambiguous, though he is generally regarded as having been ruthless and effective. He was the inspiration for the character of Vautrin in Balzac’s Comédie humaine.

3. Joseph de Maistre: see here.

4. “ultra”—ultra-royalist—newspapers: The Ultras took their name from the adjective ultraroyaliste; they were said to be “plus royalistes que le roi,” more monarchist than the monarch.

### 1.5.6: Father Fauchelevent
1. “Ten louis”: two hundred francs.

### 1.5.7: Fauchelevent Becomes a Gardener in Paris
1. The Saint-Antoine quartier of Paris: the faubourg Saint-Antoine, a mostly working-class neighbourhood on the (then) eastern edge of Paris on the right bank of the Seine.

2. Monsieur de Villèle: Jean-Baptiste Joseph de Villèle (1773–1854), a leader of the more conservative royalists under the Restoration, Villèle served as prime minister from 1822 to 1828.

### 1.5.8: Madame Victurnien Spends Thirty-five Francs on Morality
1. a red cap … to the Jacobins: i.e., left a Bernardine monastery for the Jacobin club, the radical Paris political association that was the seat of power of Robespierre. The club had affiliates in many provincial towns.

2. a bigot: see here.

### 1.5.9: Madame Victurnien’s Success
1. twelve sous a day: i.e., sixty centimes a day.

### 1.5.10: Continued Success
1. the postage costs of which were ruining her: At the time, postage was paid by the recipient of a letter, so the Thénardiers’ epistolary “bombardment” was a further expense for Fantine.

2. “two napoléons”: two louis, or forty francs.

### 1.5.11: Christus Nos Liberavit
1. Christus nos liberavit: “Christ has made us free.” Hugo used this phrase from Paul’s letter to the Galatians (5:1) as the epigraph to his royalist ode À la liberté.

### 1.5.12: The Idleness of Monsieur Bamatabois
1. the struggle of the South American republics … Morillo: The Spanish colonial empire was crumbling in the 1820s under an independence movement led by Simon Bolívar (1783–1830). General Pablo Morillo (1775–1837) led the forces that unsuccessfully fought to reestablish Spanish control.

### 1.5.13: The Answer to Some of the Municipal Police’s Questions
1. stamped paper: i.e., papier timbré; see here.

2. a property owner and voter: Under the Restoration, the voting franchise was restricted to those who paid a certain amount of taxes.

## Book 6: Javert
### 1.6.1: The Beginning of Rest
1. the bas-reliefs at Rheims: The Wise and Foolish Virgins (vierges sages et folles) are typical examples of religious art of the Middle Ages.

2. Laënnec: The physician René Laënnec (1781–1826) invented the stethoscope.

### 1.6.2: How Jean Can Turn Into Champ
1. “Cochepaille and Chenildieu”: Cochepaille suggests a contraction of cochon, “pig,” or coucher, “to sleep,” and paille, straw; Chenildieu, as Hugo later specifies, comes from “Je renie Dieu,” “I renounce God.” Their slangy names are typical of criminals and prisoners as represented in literature. Balzac and Eugène Sue used similar milieus in their fiction.
## Book 7: The Champmathieu Affair
### 1.7.1: Sister Simplice
1. Lazarist sisters: The Lazarists, like the Sisters of Charity, follow the Vincentian model of public service (see below).

2. a Capuchin nun or an Ursuline: The Capuchins are followers of the Franciscan rule; Ursuline nuns are typically devoted to teaching young girls or the care of the sick.

3. White Friar: a member of the Carmelite order.

4. Vincent de Paul: a seventeenth-century priest who founded what would become the Vincentian orders (see here).

5. Abbé Sicard … Massieu: Father Sicard (1742–1822) spent his life teaching the deaf. Massieu, we can assume, is a colleague or student.

### 1.7.3: A Storm on the Brain
1. Dante Alighieri … a sinister door: In Dante’s Inferno, the author-narrator stands before the gates of hell, above which is inscribed “Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here.” Dante’s work is a frequent point of reference for Hugo.

2. letters of credit that he held: i.e., IOUs for loans that Jean Valjean had made to local businessmen in difficulty; the debts are thus erased.

### 1.7.6: Sister Simplice is Put to the Test
1. We’ll buy some … my love is true: <br/>
Nous achèterons de bien belles choses <br/>
En nous promenant le long des faubourgs. <br/>
Les bleuets sont bleus, les roses sont roses, <br/>
Les bleuets sont bleus, j’aime mes amours. <br/>
La vierge Marie auprès de mon poêle <br/>
Est venue hier en manteau brodé; <br/>
Et m’a dit:—Voici, caché sous mon voile, <br/>
Le petit qu’un jour tu m’as demandé. <br/>
Courez à la ville, ayez de la toile, <br/>
Achetez du fil, achetez un dé. <br/>
Nous achèterons de bien belles choses <br/>
En nous promenant le long des faubourgs. <br/>
Bonne sainte Vierge, auprès de mon poêle <br/>
J’ai mis un berceau de rubans orné; <br/>
Dieu me donnerait sa plus belle étoile, <br/>
J’aime mieux l’enfant que tu m’as donné. <br/>
Madame, que faire avec cette toile? <br/>
Faites en trousseau pour mon nouveau-né. <br/>
Les bleuets sont bleus, les roses sont roses, <br/>
Les bleuets sont bleus, j’aime mes amours. <br/>
Lavez cette toile.—Où?—Dans la rivière. <br/>
Faites-en, sans rien gâter ni salir, <br/>
Une belle jupe avec sa brassière <br/>
Que je veux broder et de fleurs emplir. <br/>
L’enfant n’est plus là, madame, qu’en faire? <br/>
Faites-en un drap pour m’ensevelir. <br/>
Nous achèterous de bien belles choses <br/>
En nous promenant le long des fabourgs. <br/>
Les bleuets sont bleus, les roses sont roses, <br/>
Les bleuets sont bleus, j’aime mes amours. <br/>

### 1.7.7: The Traveller Arrives Only to Get Ready to Leave Again
1. “Monsieur de Conzié”: one of the “philosopher bishops” (see here) of the ancien régime.

### 1.7.8: Preferential Admission
1. no doubt by mistake, June 11, Year II: The date given is a blend of the Gregorian and Revolutionary calendars. Such mistakes were not uncommon in the various changes introduced by the Revolution.

### 1.7.9: A Place Where Convictions Are About to Shape Up
1. there was a crucifix … at the time he was convicted: The Revolutionary governments were secular; Catholicism was the official religion of the ancien régime, the Empire, and the Restoration governments.

2. a temple of Melpomene: Melpomene was the muse of tragedy in Greek mythology.

3. those gentle Levites: In the Hebrew tradition, the Levites were the guardians of the Temple.

4. Bénigne Bossuet: a prelate whose writings and orations were considered masterpieces of the French language as well as of religious thought; see here.

5. cunning bit of antonomasia: a rhetorical device that uses a paraphrase or euphemism to refer to an individual or group or a proper name to refer to some individual or group.

6. the immorality of the Romantic school: In the early 1820s, when this scene takes place, the young and still conservative Victor Hugo was not yet the leader of the most “satanic” elements of liberal romanticism, and he was never as far right as the Oriflamme. One wonders how what was still a relatively obscure literary movement could have driven the illiterate Champmathieu/“Jean Valjean” to commit a crime.

7. the Oriflamme and the Quotidienne: two ultra-royalist newspapers; an oriflamme was a banner carried into battle by armies in the medieval and early modern eras.

8. the tale of Théramènes: from Racine’s Phèdre, one of the most famous passages in French literature; Théramènes’s monologue recounts for Theseus the death of his son Hippolytus, whom Theseus had called on Neptune to punish because of his erroneous belief that Hippolytus had attempted to seduce his stepmother, Phaedra, when in fact it was Theseus’s wife who had attempted to seduce his son.

### 1.7.10: The Strategy of Denial
1. “the Enfants-Rouges”: an orphanage once located in the Third Arrondissement where the children were dressed in red.

2. “a good sort who never went to dances”: i.e., the public balls were frequented by grisettes and young men like Tholomyès.

3. “Shrove Tuesday”: the day before Ash Wednesday, better known as Mardi Gras. The religious connotations were still more important than those of the Carnival in nineteenth-century France.

XI: Champmathieu More and More Amazed
1. “the three letters T.F.P.”: Convicts sent to Toulon were branded with the letters TF, for travaux forcés, or “forced labour”; those sentenced to hard labour for life, like Chenildieu, were branded with TFP, travaux forcés perpetuels, “perpetual forced labour.”

## Book 8: Aftershock
### 1.7.3: Javert Satisfied
1. this monstrous Saint Michael: According to Christian tradition, the Archangel Saint Michael, or Michel, is God’s warrior, first of the angels, and chief of the heavenly hosts. Michael famously expelled Satan from heaven, an image frequently reproduced in art. Saint Michael was one of the angels who spoke to Joan of Arc, making him one of the patron saints of France from the fifteenth century onward.

### 1.7.5: A Suitable Grave
1. a galley slave: The term galérien outlasted the use of the galleys in the French navy; the term was used frequently in place of the proper term of forçat for one sentenced to forced labour.

2. the Drapeau Blanc: the White Flag, still another legitimist newspaper; note the lady’s pronunciation “Buonapartists”; the Italian pronunciation emphasized Napoléon’s foreignness.
# Part 2: Cosette
## Book 1: Waterloo
### 2.1.1: What You Meet with When You Come from Nivelles
1. Last year, 1861, on a lovely morning in May: Hugo did in fact travel to Waterloo in May 1861, in order to confirm his understanding of the battle. Even though, as he wrote in a letter, he would say only “a word” (un mot) about Waterloo in Les Misérables, he wanted to be sure of his accuracy.

2. On the horizon … looked like a lion: The king of Holland ordered a lion built on top of a hill at Waterloo in recognition of the service of his son, the prince of Orange, who had been wounded in the battle.

### 2.1.2: Hougoumont
1. Hougoumont: the old fortified manor house was the site of a key skirmish within the larger battle.

2. Henri IV: The first Bourbon reigned from 1590 to 1610.

3. Napoléon sent his brother Jérôme: Jérôme Bonaparte (1784–1860), Napoléon’s youngest brother, was named king of Westphalia by his elder brother.

4. the divisions of Guilleminot, Foy, and Bachelu: Général Comte Armand-Charles Guilleminot (1774–1840); Général Baron Gilbert Bachelu (1777–1849), and Général Comte Maximilien Foy (1775–1825). Foy would have the most significant post-Napoleonic career, as an opposition leader in the Chamber of Deputies, from 1819 until his death. His funeral became the scene of a protest against the Bourbon government.

5. Conde de Rio Maïor. Marques y Marquesa de Almagro (Habana): a vestige of the era when Belgium was known as the Spanish Netherlands, ruled by the Spanish branch of the Hapsburgs.

6. the first French style that preceded Le Nôtre: André Le Nôtre (1613–1700), the landscape architect who popularized the formal French garden, most notably at Versailles.

### 2.1.3: June 18, 1815
1. June 18, 1815: the day of the battle of Waterloo.

2. So that Waterloo could be the end of Austerlitz … a bit of rain: A key part of the Napoleonic legend was the “sun of Austerlitz.” The battle of Austerlitz began in a heavy fog. The French soldiers advanced in spite of it, and when the sun suddenly burned off the mist, the Russian and Austrian troops were stunned to find a massive French force virtually on top of them. At Waterloo, by contrast, the heavy rains and muddy ground prevented Napoléon from executing his plans as he would have wished.

3. Blücher: commander of the Prussian forces in 1815; see here.

4. Aboukir: During General Bonaparte’s ill-fated Egyptian 1798–99 campaign under the Directoire, there were two battles at Aboukir, near Alexandria. At the first, Nelson decimated the French fleet, which had just left Bonaparte’s army; at the second, Napoléon’s cannons repulsed a landing of Turkish troops backed by the British navy.

5. Wellington: The commander of the allied armies, Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington (1769–1852), had made his name and earned his dukedom by driving the French out of Spain in 1812–13. Waterloo made him one of the most powerful men in Europe.

6. Napoléon’s … point of view: Napoléon’s point of view was given by Mémoires pour servir à l’histoire de France sous Napoléon, written according to Napoléon’s dictation and published by the loyal generals who had accompanied him in his final exile, including Bertrand, Montholon, and Gourgaud, and published in six volumes from 1823 to 1825; the Mémorial de Sainte-Hélène by Emmanuel de Las Cases was enormously popular when published in 1826. The glittering array of historians who gave the “opposite point of view” were those Hugo read or reviewed in exile, such as Charras (see here), Quinet, Adolphe Thiers, and Vaulabelle.

### 2.1.4: A
1. the College of Brienne: Napoléon Bonaparte had attended the military academy at Brienne thanks to a royal scholarship from 1778 to 1785 (from the age of nine to sixteen).

2. the Marengo sword: Marengo (Italy), site of a great victory over the Austrians for First Consul Bonaparte on July 14, 1800.

3. Babylon sacked … diminishes Titus: “Babylon sacked” alludes to Alexander’s conquest of the city in his war against the Persian king Darius III; “Rome in chains” refers to Caesar’s establishment of the dictatorship in the ancient republic; “Jerusalem massacred” to Titus Flavius Vespasianus’s harsh repression of the Jewish rebellion in the year 70, during which the Great Temple of Jerusalem was razed. Titus did not actually succeed his father, Vespasian, as emperor until 79.

### 2.1.5: The Quid Obscurum of Battles
1. Ney: Michel Ney (1769–1815) was one of Napoléon’s favourite generals, nicknamed “le brave des braves.” Named marshal of the Empire in 1804, he played decisive roles in the battles of Elchingen, Eylau, and the Moskova. He was made duc d’Elchingen in 1808 and prince de la Moskova in 1813. Ney rallied to the Bourbons in 1814, and when Napoléon landed at Juan Gulf after escaping from Elba, Ney promised Louis XVIII that he would bring Napoléon back to Paris in an iron cage. He rode south from Paris, but—in no small part due to the obvious sentiments of his troops—reconciled with his emperor when they met. After the return of the Bourbons, Ney was arrested, tried, and shot by a firing squad.

2. something for Salvator Rosa, not for Gribeauval: The Italian painter and poet Salvator Rosa (1615–73) specialized in battle scenes; Jean-Baptiste Vauquette de Gribeauval (1715–89) was a famous officer in the artillery.

3. Quid obscurum, quid divinum: something obscure, something divine.

4. Van der Meulen: The Dutch painter Antoine-François van der Meulen (1634–90) came to France at the invitation of Louis XIV, who admired his depictions of battle.

5. This is what gives Folard … Polybius: The military theorist Jean-Charles de Folard (1669–1752) was best known for a treatise refuting an ancient Greek predecessor, the historian Polybius (ca. 200–120 B.C.E.).

### 2.1.6: Four O’clock in the Afternoon
1. as Charras says: Jean-Baptiste Charras (1810–65), a military officer elected to the Chamber of Deputies of the Second Republic in 1848. Exiled by Louis-Napoléon in 1852, he wrote his Histoire de la Campagne de 1815: Waterloo in Brussels, where it was published in 1857. This was Hugo’s primary source for his retelling of the battle.

2. Wellington shouted … Talavera, Vitoria, and Salamanca: victories of Wellington’s armies in the Portuguese and Spanish campaigns. General Hugo fought at Talavera and Vitoria.

### 2.1.7: Napoléon in a Good Mood
1. Ridet Caesar, Pompeius flebit: “Caesar laughed, Pompey wept”—a reference to the battle of Pharsalus, where Caesar and his armies, including the Fulminatrix Legion (the Thundering Legion), defeated the forces of Pompey the Great in 48 B.C.E. It is not clear if Hugo took this phrase from some classical source or paraphrased it, but he was quite capable of composing a Latin phrase on his own. It is interesting to note that although Napoléon lost the battle, he is still compared to Caesar, while the victorious Wellington is a Pompey who “this time did not have to weep.”

2. Bertrand: see here.

3. Soult: Imperial general named duc de Dalmatia by Napoléon; see here, here.

4. Fleury de Chaboulon: Napoléon’s secretary.

5. Gourgaud: one of the contributors to the Mémoires pour servir à l’histoire de France sous Napoléon (see here).

6. Benjamin Constant: Benjamin Constant de Robeque (1767–1830) was born in Lausanne, Switzerland, and emigrated to France under the Directoire. Initially a supporter of Bonaparte, he became a critic of the Empire under the influence of his lover, Madame de Staël, and both were exiled in 1803. In 1815, Napoléon asked him to draft a new constitution for the Empire as a gesture to liberals. After the Bourbons returned, his political activity was limited to the opposition press. He is best remembered today for his novel Adolphe, an autobiographical account of his affair with Madame de Staël.

7. the mysterious trip from the isle of Elba to France: The question of how Napoléon managed to escape from Elba largely undetected is still somewhat controversial.

8. the white cockade: A cockade was a small cloth badge worn with a military hat. The question of whether the military would wear white (Bourbon) or tricolour (associated with the Revolution) cockades was a major point of dispute as the return of the Bourbons was negotiated in 1814 and 1815. Civilian supporters of royalist and constitutionalist causes showed their politics through cockades as well. The politics of the cockade were also important in the early Revolutionary years.

9. the amaranth strewn with bees: Napoléon’s personal heraldry, distinct from the imperial eagle. The bee was chosen as it was believed to have been a symbol of the Merovingian kings.

10. Scabra rubigine: i.e., a coarse rust, from Virgil’s Georgics, a reference to what remains after a battle.

### 2.1.8: The Emperor Puts a Question to Lacoste, the Guide
1. Grouchy’s delay: General Emmanuel de Grouchy (1766–1847) had concentrated his forces on a wing of the Prussian army, rather than joining the main battle; this was seen as one of the reasons the close battle turned against the French.

2. Beresina, Leipzig, and Fontainebleau: three of the greatest disasters of Napoléon’s career. At the crossing of the half-frozen Beresina River in November 1812, during the Grande Armée’s retreat from Moscow, already devastated by difficult battles, lack of food, and the Russian winter, the army lost more than ten thousand men, either killed by the pursuing Cossacks or drowning in an attempt to cross the bridges hastily constructed by the French engineers. Leipzig was a catastrophic, arguably fatal, defeat for Napoléon at the hands of the allies in October 1813. Napoléon had withdrawn to Fontainebleau when the allies reached Paris in March 1814; while his emissaries were negotiating the possibility of Napoléon retaining the throne in return for abandoning conquered territories, some of his most trusted generals defected, making his abdication inevitable.

3. the final overthrow of England … cancelling out Agincourt: Hugo sums up five hundred years of enmity between France and England. Edward III of England defeated Philippe VI of France at Crécy in 1346, the first major battle of the Hundred Years’ War. In 1356, the Black Prince not only defeated the French but captured King Jean II at Poitiers. Malplaquet was a costly, even Pyrrhic, victory for the English and their Austrian allies over the forces of Louis XIV during the War of the Spanish Succession in 1709. The duke of Marlborough drove the French out of Belgium after the battle of Ramillies, in 1607. Napoléon, the man from Marengo, would delete the legendary English victory at Agincourt in 1415, the battle for which, according to Shakespeare, Henry V rallied his troops with his Saint Crispin’s Day speech: “We few, we happy few, we band of brothers” (Henry V, act 4, scene 3).

### 2.1.9: The Unexpected
1. the great redoubt of the Moskowa: On September 7, 1812, at Borodino on the Moskowa River outside the Russian capital, 130,000 French troops attacked 135,000 Russians based in a large fortification or redoubt. The bloodiest single battle of the Napoleonic wars, one of the bloodiest in European history, it resulted in almost thirty thousand casualties for the French, fifty thousand for the Russians. After the Russian retreat, Napoléon entered Moscow.

2. Murat was missing: Joachim Murat (1767–1815) owed his reputation more to his reckless courage than his skill as a general. Married to Napoléon’s imperious and ambitious sister Caroline, Murat was named grand duke of Berg and Cleves before taking the place of his brother-in-law Joseph on the throne of Naples. After an unsuccessful attempt to retain his throne in 1814, he rallied to Napoléon during the Hundred Days, but was prevented from reaching France by an Austrian army at Tolentino in northern Italy, on May 2. He was eventually captured and shot by forces loyal to the Bourbon king of Naples.

3. the old Orphic sagas: i.e., Greek mythology. Orpheus, the son of the muse Calliope, was given a lyre by Apollo and taught song and poetry to mortals.

### 2.1.10: The Plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean
1. the prince de Condé … Louis XVIII at Ghent: The prince de Condé was the Bourbons’ cousin; he took refuge at Malines, Belgium, while the king waited for the outcome of Waterloo at Ghent.

### 2.1.11: Bad Guide for Napoléon, Good Guide for Bülow
1. the duc de Dalmatia: General Nicolas-Jean de Dieu Soult (1769–1851), named marshal of the Empire in 1804 and duc de Dalmatia in 1808 (Napoléon liked to give his generals and ministers foreign titles to emphasize the breadth of his conquests and his empire). Soult was named minister of war by Louis XVIII in 1814 but rallied to Napoléon in 1815. Exiled until 1819, Soult served the government of Louis-Philippe in several capacities, including minister of war, foreign minister, and prime minister.

### 2.1.13: The Catastrophe
1. the Uhlans: traditionally the Polish cavalry; both the Prussian and Austrian armies had corps of Uhlans in the nineteenth century.

2. The Grande Armée: a term Napoléon used inconsistently to describe his own forces from 1805, during the march toward Austerlitz, up until Waterloo.

3. Hoc erat in fatis: “Thus was their fate.”

### 2.1.4: The Last Square
1. Ulm, Wagram, Jena, Friedland: some of Napoléon’s greatest military victories.

2. Cambronne: Pierre-Jacques-Étienne Cambronne (1770–1842) volunteered for the Revolutionary armies and rose up through the ranks through courage, talent, and his devotion to Napoléon, whom he followed to Elba in 1814 and back to France in 1815. After he had married an Englishwoman and been named a viscount by Louis XVIII, he both denied and affirmed the mot that had made him famous. According to his own accounts and those of eyewitnesses, he may have said, in response to calls to surrender, “The Guard dies, it does not surrender!” or “Bastards [bougres] like us don’t give up!” In fact, Cambronne was forced to surrender after being seriously wounded and was taken prisoner by the English.

3. “Shit!”: “Merde!”; Hugo was criticized for including this word in his novel; he defended it by pointing out that it was “le misérable des mots.” Hugo prized the “soldierly energy” of “Shit!” to the other responses reported.

### 2.1.15: Cambronne
1. among all these giants, there was a Titan: i.e., one even greater than the giants. The Titans were the race of Greek gods who preceded the Olympians.

2. round off Leonidas with Rabelais: i.e., to end the battle with the earthy and unshakable good humour typical of the French. Leonidas was the Spartan king who led his three hundred men to certain death at Thermopylae; François Rabelais (1494–1553) was one of the greatest writers of the French Renaissance. His comic novels Pantagruel and Gargantua combine broad humour, frequently scatological and sexual, with the humanistic ideals of the Renaissance.

3. Aeschylus: a playwright of ancient Greece (ca. 535–456 B.C.E.), considered the father of tragedy.

4. the way Rouget de l’Isle … the “Marseillaise”: Claude-Joseph Rouget de l’Isle (1760–1836) wrote the “Marseillaise” in one night, in April 1792.

5. like Danton talking or Kléber roaring: Danton was the great popular orator of the French Revolution. The force of his rhetoric and his popularity with the Parisian masses were such that Robespierre refused to allow him to speak in his own defence while on trial. Jean-Baptiste Kléber (1753–1800) was known for his fierceness in battle. He served under Bonaparte during the Egyptian campaign and remained behind to command the French forces when Bonaparte returned to France to arrange the coup d’état of 18 Brumaire. Kléber had negotiated the French evacuation when he was assassinated in Cairo in January 1800.

### 2.1.16: Quot Libras in Duce?
1. Quot Libras in Duce?: “What does the chief weigh?,” i.e., “What is the value of a leader?”

2. Jomini … Müffling … Charras: three historians of the Napoleonic era. Antoine-Henri Jomini (1779–1869) served under Ney until he was passed over for promotion by Berthier in 1813; he defected to the Russians and served as the czar’s aide-de-camp. He wrote several works of military history while serving in the Russian military. Karl von Müffling was a Prussian general who served as Blücher’s liaison to Wellington at Waterloo; he subsequently published an account of the battle. Charras (see here) was Hugo’s primary source for details about Waterloo.

3. above Blücher … Goethe and above Wellington … Byron: Hugo, known first and foremost as a poet, firmly believed in the social value of the poet, the prophet and priest of humanity. Left unsaid is which French poet is greater than Napoléon, the greatest general.

4. God, who likes an antithesis: Hugo was also fond of antitheses.

5. the Barrême of the war … Michelangelo: Barrême was a scientist, making Napoléon Bonaparte the inspired genius as opposed to the technician of war that was Wellington, the prudhomme militaire (see here).

6. Beaulieu … Mélas: a succession of Austrian generals defeated by Bonaparte in Italy. All of them commanded Austrian forces in the battles listed in the following note in the years before the Empire.

7. Lodi … Arcola: a string of Napoleonic victories over the Austrians in Italy: the defeat of the Austrians at Lodi in 1796; Montebello in 1800; Montenotte in 1796; Arcola outside Mantua in 1796; Marengo in 1800.

8. another young Wurmser: another unflattering reference to Wellington, as a member of the “military academe.”

9. Lord Bathurst: British minister of war at the time of Waterloo.

10. Essling and Rivoli: two more victories. The French defeated the Austrians at Essling, just outside of Vienna in 1809; Rivoli was another defeat of the Austrians in January 1797. General Masséna, Duc de Rivoli and Prince d’Essling, played a key role in both battles.

11. 1688 and our 1789: the two great revolutions and their consequences were often compared to each other after 1789.

12. Bautzen: The 1813 victory over Prussian and Russian forces was a hard-fought one for the French.

13. Virgil before the fatal plain of Philippi: another reference to the Georgics. The plain of Philippi in Greece was site of the final defeat of Brutus and Cassius by Mark Antony and Octavius in 42 B.C.E.

### 2.1.17: Do We Have to Think Waterloo Was a Good Thing?
1. it is July 14, 1789, attacked via March 20, 1815: It was on March 20 that Napoléon returned to Paris from Elba.

2. the Brunswicks … the Bourbons: the royal houses of “legitimist” Europe aligned against Bonaparte: the Brunswicks (Hanovers) of Great Britain, the Nassaus of Holland, the Romanoffs of Russia, the Hohenzollerns of Prussia, the Hapsburgs of Austria, and the Bourbons of France.

3. Louis XVIII’s granting the Charter: Upon returning to France, Louis XVIII agreed to recognize a written constitution, known as the Charter, or Charte.

4. Bonaparte places a coachman … the throne of Sweden: The detractors of Napoléon’s brother-in-law Joachim Murat, named king of Naples in 1809, claimed that he had begun as a mere groom; he was in fact a cavalry soldier. The sergeant Napoléon placed on the throne of Sweden was Jean-Jules-Baptiste Bernadotte (1763–1844), who began as a sergeant before rising to the rank of general in the Revolutionary armies; in 1810, the Swedish parliament, seeking to curry favour with Napoléon, elected him the prince-heir of the childless Charles XIII. When the political and military tide turned against Napoléon, Bernadotte went with it. Bernadotte’s descendants still hold the throne of Sweden.

5. Louis XVIII at Saint-Ouen: It was at Saint-Ouen, on the road from Rouen to Paris, that Louis XVIII negotiated the final details of his return to power, including official recognition of the 1790 Declaration of the Rights of Man.

6. turn Foy … into an orator: General-Comte Maximillien-Sébastien Foy (1775–1825) became one of the leaders of liberal opposition in the Chamber of Deputies after serving in the Revolutionary and imperial armies. His public funeral became a demonstration against the government of Charles X.

7. the man who bounded over the Alps … doddering old invalid of father Élysée: Napoléon’s crossing of the Alps with an entire army in 1800 was part of the Napoleonic legend, immortalized in a famous painting by Jacques-Louis David. The doddering invalid refers to Louis XVIII; father Élysée was his personal physician. Besides being a gout sufferer, the king suffered from crippling obesity and generally poor health.

8. including, they say, the baton of the maréchal de France: The presentation of the marshal’s baton, an honour reserved to the greatest defenders of the realm, to the conqueror of French armies was obviously done with as little fanfare as possible.

### 2.1.18: A Fresh Bout of Divine Right
1. The Corsican became … the man from the Béarn: Henri IV (born 1553, reigned 1589–1610), founder of the Bourbon dynasty, born in the Kingdom of Navarre in modern southwestern France (le Béarnais) was a popular figure even among the revolutionaries. In the French national imagination, the earthy warrior, noble and generous, was the embodiment of what a king should be.

2. The flag … was white: The white flag, like the white cockade, was a symbol of the Bourbon dynasty.

3. Hartwell’s: Hartwell was the country estate in Kent, England, where Louis XVIII, known as the comte de Lille, spent the last years of his exile.

4. People talked about Bouvines and Fontenoy: two great military victories for ancien régime France—Bouvines in 1214, Fontenoy in 1745.

5. Europe wore the white cockade: i.e., Europe supported the return of the Bourbons.

6. Trestaillon: Jacques Dupont took the name of Trestaillon as one of the leaders of the “White Terror,” a series of often bloody reprisals against revolutionaries and imperialists (and sometimes Protestants and Jews), in Nîmes; though a national phenomenon, the Terreur blanche was especially violent in the south (Nîmes, Avignon, and Toulouse).

7. non pluribus impar: “Inferior to None,” the personal heraldic motto of Louis XIV, as the “sunburst” and its rays represent the Sun King.

8. Maison Rouge: Under the ancien régime, the company known as the Maison Rouge had been, essentially, the royal bodyguard.

9. The arc du Carrousel … the duc d’Angoulême: Napoléon had built the triumphal arch in the place du Carrousel in 1806; a statue of the duc d’Angoulême, elder son of the future Charles X and thus heir presumptive to the throne, gave the Napoleonic monument a legitimist gloss.

10. The cemetery of the Madeleine … ’93: The bodies of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were thrown into a mass grave near the place de la Madeleine. The Restoration government went to great lengths to recover the remains of the royal martyrs.

11. the moat of Vincennes … the duc d’Enghien: Louis-Antoine-Henri de Bourbon-Condé, Duc d’Énghien, cousin of the Bourbons and prince of the blood royal, was shot in the dry moat of Vincennes castle on March 21, 1804, after having been kidnapped on German territory by Bonaparte’s order. Considered an act of political terrorism by most of Europe, it was this execution that prompted the famous political aphorism, variously attributed to Talleyrand and Fouché, “It’s worse than a crime, it is a mistake.” Napoléon was actually crowned in December 1804, but it was in March that the Senate, under the instigation of Fouché, proposed that the consul for life be named emperor of the French.

12. Pope Pius VII: Elected to the papacy in 1800, Pius VII had come to France to officiate at the coronation of Napoléon, who had restored Catholicism to its official place in French society; their entente was short-lived, however; Napoléon steadily absorbed the Papal States into his Empire, and in 1809 the pope was forcibly taken from Rome to Fontainebleau as Napoléon’s prisoner.

13. in Schönbrunn Castle … the king of Rome: Napoléon had named his son king of Rome almost upon his birth in 1811. In 1814, Marie-Louise took him back to her father’s palace in Vienna and quickly lost interest in her and her son’s claims to the imperial throne. Known in Austria as the duke of Reichstadt, Napoléon II died of tuberculosis at the age of twenty-one.

14. Article 14: the broadly written article of the Charter of 1814 that established the powers of the king as head of state.

15. People’s imaginations: The Napoleonic legend never faded among many old soldiers and peasants, who saw Napoléon as the conqueror who had reestablished peace at home and glory abroad. The legend grew stronger after Bonaparte died in 1821.

16. a Holy Alliance: An alliance of European powers (mainly Russia, Prussia, Austria, and France) formed during the Congress of Vienna, the Holy Alliance became an expression of counterrevolutionary monarchism, its chief accomplishment being the restoration of the absolute monarchy in Spain in 1823. After the death in 1825 of Czar Alexander I of Russia, whose mystic idealism had provided the background of its founding, the Alliance ceased to function.

17. Hudson Lowe … Montchenu: At Longwood, the house on Saint Helena where he was kept prisoner, the former emperor constantly complained of the treatment he received at the hands of Sir Hudson Lowe, the British governor of the island. The Marquis de Montchenu was the French commissioner to Saint Helena.

18. Alexander: Czar Alexander I of Russia had been fascinated by Napoléon, and the two emperors had reached a fragile entente before the issue of Poland reignited their enmity.

19. Bonapartist liberalism: Many Bonapartists, whether from conviction or resentment against the Bourbons, became members of the liberal opposition. Much of this liberalism proved ephemeral when Louis-Philippe replaced the Bourbons in 1830.

20. The Congress of Vienna: In 1814, the powers of Europe, dominated by Great Britain, Russia, Austria, and Prussia, convened in Vienna to redraw the political map of Europe. Talleyrand had managed to negotiate relatively favourable terms for France before news of Napoléon’s return reached the Congress. The post-Waterloo treaties of 1815 were much harsher for the French, including loss of territory, foreign occupation, and huge indemnities.

### 2.1.19: The Battlefield by Night
1. sic vos non vobis: an allusion to Virgil’s satire of a plagiarist: “Thus you [do] not for yourself,” i.e., one who takes undeserved credit.

2. marquis de Fervacques: The 1544 battle of Cérisoles (Ceresole Alba, in northern Italy) was a victory for the French under Francis I over the forces of Charles V Hapsburg (see here). The source of Hugo’s anecdote about the marquis de Fervacques is unclear.

3. Turenne … the Palatinate: Henri de La Tour d’Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne (1611–75), was one of the great French generals of the seventeenth century. His armies laid waste to the German principality of the Palatinate in 1672.

4. Hoche and Marceau: Louis-Lazare Hoche (1768–97) and François-Sévérin Marceau (1769–96), contemporaries of Bonaparte and, like him, wunderkind generals of the Revolutionary armies. Napoléon believed that had they lived, they might have been his rivals. Hoche died of tuberculosis, Marceau of wounds received in battle.

## Book 2: The Ship Orion
### 2.2.: Number 24601 Becomes Number 9430
1. Number 24601: According to the Hugo legend, 24601 is a tribute to the day the great poet was conceived (June 24, 1801), on a mountaintop in the Vosges. He was born on February 26, 1802.

2. the Drapeau blanc: Hugo imitated the style of the two royalist newspapers the Drapeau blanc and the Journal de Paris in his pastiches. The Drapeau blanc (White Flag) was more staid than the sensationalist Journal de Paris.

3. the patriarch of Ferney: Voltaire spent much of the last half of his life on an estate at Ferney, near the Swiss border, in case prudence dictated an absence from French territory.

4. the Constitutionnel: an opposition newspaper that favoured a more liberal, constitutional monarchy; sometimes considered anticlerical.

### 2.2.2: In Which You Will Read Two Lines of Verse That Are Perhaps the Devil’s
1. a bad Norman monk named Tryphon: Tryphon, his verses, and the Montfermeil legend about the devil’s treasure all seem to have been invented out of whole cloth by Hugo.

2. Dig … things: “Fodit, et in fossa thesauros condit opaca / As, nummos, lapides, cadaver, simulacra, nihilque.”

3. Roger Bacon: The English monk, philosopher, and scientist (ca. 1215–90) was the first European to record a recipe for gunpowder.

4. Charles VI: or Charles the Mad, reigned from 1368 to 1422.

### 2.2.3: How the Chain on the Shackles Must Have Undergone Preparatory Treatment to Be Shattered Like That with One Whack of the Hammer
1. “the war with Spain”: With the backing of the Holy Alliance, France sent a military force to reestablish the authority of Ferdinand VII, who had been forced by the Spanish parliament, the Cortes, to accept a liberal constitution. The French forces under the duc d’Angoulême met little resistance, as the king was more popular than the Cortes. The war was considered a “big family affair,” as the Spanish Bourbons were descended from a grandson of Louis XIV.

2. “the hero of Andujar”: The city of Andujar was the site of the treaty that put an end to the Spanish War. The treaty was not as severe as many conservatives had hoped.

3. very real terrorism of the Holy Office: i.e., the Spanish Inquisition.

4. descamisados: literally, “shirtless ones,” i.e., the peasantry and the working class.

5. the generalissimo son of France: i.e., the duc d’Angoulême; the title Fils de France was a relic of the ancien régime.

6. the prince de Carignan: The Carignan family was the French branch of the royal house of Savoy, Charles-Albert took the throne in 1823; his grandson, Victor Emmanuel, was the first king of unified Italy in 1870.

7. Koblenz: Under the leadership of the prince de Condé and later the comte d’Artois, armies of émigrés gathered at Koblenz in 1789–92. The battle to restore divine-right monarchs was seen by many as a religious duty.

8. the war of 1808 … Saragossa: Napoléon’s attempted conquest of Spain was far more difficult than Angoulême’s intervention on behalf of the king. The city of Saragossa fell only after a long and bloody siege.

9. Palafox: José de Rebolledo Palafox y Melzi was the Spanish officer who became chief of the Spanish resistance to Napoléon; he was captured at Saragossa.

10. Rostopchine … Ballesteros: As governor of Moscow, it was Count Rostopchine who decided to burn the city rather than allow the French army to occupy and pillage it in 1812; Francisco Ballesteros had earned his military reputation in the resistance to Napoléon’s occupation but quickly surrendered to the duc d’Angoulême and the Banque de France.

11. 1823 sowed the seeds of 1830: i.e., the apparent triumph of legitimacy led to the reactionary decrees of July 1830, which would provoke the July Revolution and the final collapse of the Bourbon monarchy.

12. de Ruyter: Michael de Ruyter (1613–77), a Dutch admiral and naval hero.

## Book 3: Keeping the Promise Made to the Dead Woman
### 2.3.1: The Issue of Water at Montfermeil
1. a liard: an old copper coin worth less than a sou.

### 2.3.2: Two Portraits Completed
1. the abbé Delille: Jacques Delille (1738–1813), a poet and translator of Virgil’s Georgics.

2. Voltaire … oddly, Saint Augustine: The abbés Raynal (1713–96) and Parny (1753–1813) were well-known figures of the Enlightenment, friends of Voltaire; Saint Augustine (354–430), of course, is the odd man out.

3. the Champ d’Asile fund: a fund started to support an ultimately unsuccessful colony of Napoleonic veterans in Texas.

### 2.3.6: Which Perhaps Proves Boulatruelle’s Intelligence
1. His massive berlin: The berline was a large, often open carriage, often used in public ceremonies or parades.

2. a scholar’s smile: Witty and well-read, Louis XVIII fancied himself an intellectual.

3. the Golden Fleece … wide blue sash: The French king is adorned with the highest chivalric orders of Europe. The Golden Fleece of Spain was established by Charles V in the sixteenth century; the French order of Saint Louis by Louis XIV in 1693; the Order of the Holy Spirit (Saint-Ésprit), also French, dated from the reign of Henri III; the “blue sash” is the cordon bleu of the Order of the Holy Spirit.

4. quartier Saint-Marceau: a then working-class neighbourhood in the southeastern part of the city.

5. le duc d’Havré: one of Louis XVIII’s most trusted courtiers.

6. Monsieur le comte d’Anglès: see here.

7. The Two Convicts: a melodrama that in fact debuted at the Porte Saint-Martin theatre in 1822.

### 2.3.8: Unpleasantness of Putting Up a Pauper Who Might Just Be Rich
1. Monsieur Laffitte: Jacques Laffitte (1767–1844), a Parisian banker who played an important role in the liberal opposition from 1815 until his death.

2. a moujik: a Russian peasant.

3. the duchesse de Berry: Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Sicile (1798–1870), the widow of Charles X’s younger son, the duc de Berry, and mother of his posthumous son, known as the duc de Bordeaux, designated even before his birth as the heir to the Bourbons. see here, and here.

4. the Courrier français: a liberal weekly newspaper appeared under that name from 1819 to 1821, one of several over the course of the nineteenth century.

5. orange blossom: French brides traditionally wear orange blossoms in their hair.

### 2.3.9: Thénardier in Operation
1. doors and windows: Houses were taxed according to the number of doors and windows they had, a sort of luxury tax (see here).

2. the little Prussian pigtail … the crown of laurel: On louis and napoléons, see here. The Prussian pigtail designates the old-fashioned hairstyle favoured by the Bourbons; the crown of laurel, the classical sign of the victor, was plainly visible in Napoléon’s profile on imperial coinage.

## Book 4: The Old Gorbeau Slum
### 2.4.1: Maître Gorbeau
1. La Salpêtrière … the barrière de l’Italie: La Salpetrière was (and is) a large hospital located on the eastern edge of the city, on the south side of the Seine; the barrière d’Italie, roughly at the site of today’s place d’Italie, marked the southeastern edge of the city.

2. Châtelet: Once the site of a small defensive fortress on the Right Bank, the Châtelet served as both a prison and a court of criminal law throughout the Revolutionary period. It was demolished by Napoléon’s order in 1808.

3. Two names anticipated by La Fontaine: Jean de La Fontaine (1621–95), one of the most celebrated of French writers; his Fables contained brilliant social and political satire. Le Corbeau et le renard is one of his most famous works.

4. Maître Corbeau … Hello! etc.: “Maître Corbeau, sur un dossier perché, / Tenait dans son bec une saisie executoire; / Maître Renard, par l’odeur alléché, / Lui fit à peu près cette histoire: / Hé! bonjour! etc.”

5. Louis XV … Madame Du Barry: The legendary debauchery of Louis XV (born 1710, reigned 1715–1775) was such that it is difficult to tell which stories about it are apocryphal. This anecdote, which includes royal, aristocratic, and clerical decadence, does seem too good to be true. The papal nuncio was essentially the Vatican’s ambassador to the French court; the cardinal de La Roche-Aymon (1697–1777) was the archbishop of Reims and grand almoner of France; Louis’ affair with the former prostitute Jeanne Bécu, Comtesse du Barry, whose political influence was wildly exaggerated by propagandists, was the nadir of his satyric adventures.

6. Bicêtre: a notorious prison on what was then the southeastern boundary of Paris.

7. “the murder of the barrière de Fontainebleau”: the barrière de Fontainebleau, near today’s place d’Italie. In 1827, Hugo saw a young man named Ulbach executed for the murder of a young farm girl on the suburban outskirts of Paris.

8. the mean and shameful place de Grève: the site of public executions until 1830, today known as the place de l’Hotel de Ville, on the Right Bank.

9. the Orléans railway station: now the Gare d’Austerlitz.

## Book 5: A Mute Pack of Hounds for a Dirty Hunt
### 2.5.1: The Zigzags of Strategy
1. the author of this book … has been absent from Paris: It was in December 1851—only a few days after Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte had successfully managed a coup d’état that made him Emperor Napoléon III—that Hugo boarded a train for Brussels. He would not return to Paris until 1870, spending most of the intervening decades on the British island of Jersey. During his absence, the Second Empire, in the person of Baron Haussmann, would effect the transformations Hugo describes in this passage.

2. Saint-Étienne-du-Mont: a church on top of montagne Sainte-Geneviève, just behind the Panthéon.

### 2.5.2: It is a Good Thing the Austerlitz Bridge Takes Vehicles
1. This is … sells tiles: “De Goblet fils e’est ici la fabrique; / Venez choisir des cruches et des brocs, / Des pots à fleurs, des tugaux, de la brique. / A tout venant le Cœur vend des Carreaux.”

### 2.5.3: See the 1727 Map of Paris
1. See the 1727 Map of Paris: There is something of a wink in this chapter title as Hugo departs from his geographical realism to describe a fictional neighbourhood and convent. Up until Jean Valjean and Cosette cross the Austerlitz bridge, their path follows real streets of pre-Haussmann Paris, following the western edge of the city from the barrière de Fontainebleau to the Seine. Hugo modelled the Petit-Picpus neighbourhood after the faubourg Saint-Antoine and the convent after one in the faubourg Saint-Marceau. The streets surrounding the convent are likewise inventions of the author.

### 2.5.10: In Which It Is Explained How Javert Came Up Empty
1. the triumphant entry into Bayonne: the return of the victorious duc d’Angoulême from Spain; see here.

2. Seine-et-Oise: the département just northwest of Paris, where Montfermeil is located.

3. Danton … Arcis-sur-Aube: Danton (see here), in the spring of 1794, did not take seriously enough the threat posed by Robespierre’s consolidation of power in the Convention. By the time Danton returned from his country home to Paris, Robespierre had triumphed and Danton’s fate was sealed. He was guillotined on April 5, 1794.

## Book 6: Petit-Picpus
### 2.6.2: The Rule of Martin Verga
1. Martin Verga: Hugo created an imaginary religious order based on the name of a fifteenth-century Spanish Cistercian, Martin de Vargas, who instigated reforms within the order but did not found a new rule.

2. Bernardines: i.e., Cistercians, among the strictest of monastic orders. As Hugo explains, the monastery of Cîteaux, and thus the Cistercian order, was founded in 1098 by Saint Robert de Molesme, who wanted to reestablish strict obedience to the monastic rules laid down by Saint Benedict (ca. 480–ca. 547), the founder of the Western tradition of monasticism. Robert was eclipsed by the prestige of his successor as abbot of Cîteaux, Saint Bernard (1090–1138), who founded a number of filial abbeys, most notably Clairvaux. As Hugo indicates, a number of medieval religious orders were founded as an attempt to return to the original rule of Saint Benedict.

3. he was old and … hermit: Hugo seems to be playing on the old French proverb “When the devil gets old, he’ll become a monk.” One of the abbeys Saint Benedict founded is the famous abbey of Monte Cassino, previously the site of a pagan temple dedicated to Apollo.

4. Ladies of the Blessed Sacrament: This was a real convent in the rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève, on the left bank, that Hugo had originally thought to use as Jean Valjean’s retreat before deciding to invent a convent, and even a fictional order, in order to avoid offending any real religious communities.

5. Philip di Neri … Pierre de Bérulle: Philip di Neri (1515–95) was founder of the order of the Oratory in Italy. Pierre de Bérulle (1575–1629) founded the French Oratory.

### 2.6.3: The Austerities
1. mademoiselles de Sainte-Aulaire and de Bélissen: Sainte-Aulaire and de Bélissen were the names of well-known families of the French aristocracy, as were the Choiseuls and the Sérents, mentioned later.

2. Talbot: the family name of the earls of Shrewsbury, several of whom remained in the Catholic Church after the Reformation.

### 2.6.4: Fun
1. There … in prison: “ Il est arrivé un coup de bâton. / C’est Polichinelle qui l’a donné au chat. / Ça ne lui a pas fait de bien, ça lui a fait du mal. / Alors une dame a mis Polichinelle en prison.”

### 2.6.5: Entertainment
1. the Lives of the Saints: Several books were devoted to the stories of Catholic saints. Hugo may refer here to Dom Mabillon’s Lives of the Benedictine Saints (see here) or to the Lives of the Saints of the Order of Saint Benedict by Marguerite de Blemeur (see here), supposed ancestress of Mother Innocent.

2. Nemo regulas … communicabit: “No one shall discuss our rules or our institution with outsiders.”

3. Montmorencys: The Montmorencys claimed direct descent from one of Charlemagne’s barons.

4. Monseigneur de Quélen: Louis-Hyancinthe de Quélen (1778–1839), archbishop of Paris from 1821 until his death.

5. Monsieur le duc de Rohan: Louis-François-Auguste de Rohan-Chabot (1788–1833), known as the prince de Léon before succeeding his father as duc de Rohan; one of the most elegant young men of the grand monde, he shocked his family and friends by entering the priesthood after the death of his young wife in 1815. He was named archbishop of Auch in 1828 and later cardinal archbishop of Besançon. He was the model for the elegant bishop of Agde in Stendhal’s The Red and the Black. Hugo knew the ducal archbishop in the 1820s.

### 2.6.6: The Little Convent
1. the Ladies of Sainte-Aure: The small community of Sainte-Aure occupied a house next to the Benedictine convent Hugo based Petit-Picpus on; it was destroyed and disbanded during the Revolution.

2. Madame de Beaufort d’Hautpoul and Madame la marquise Dufresne: Again Hugo has used real names in his invented convent.

3. Madame de Genlis: As a shocking and ostentatious gesture of modernity, the duc d’Orléans, later known as Philippe-Égalité, hired the comtesse de Genlis (1746–1830), who was also his mistress, as tutor for his children, including the future King Louis-Philippe, in the 1780s. During the Revolution, she emigrated to England, where she supported herself by writing novels. She entered her “ferociously devout phase” on returning to France in 1800. Napoléon gave her a pension and, it was widely believed, employed her as a spy among her circle of friends.

4. Imparibus meritis … tua perdas: “Three bodies of unequal merit hang from the branches; / Dismas and Gesmas and the power of the divine; / Dismas wishes to go on high; unhappy Gesmas will go below; / Let our bodies and our goods be protected by the Supreme Power. / Recite these verses so that theft shall not deprive you of what is yours.”

5. Dismas and Gestas: According to extracanonical tradition, Dismas and Gestas were the two thieves crucified along with Jesus on the hill at Golgotha. Gestas, on Jesus’s left, mocked the Son of God for not saving his own life. Dismas asked Christ for mercy and went to heaven.

6. the vicomte de Gestas: It would seem an odd thing to brag about, but such claims were not unheard of. An eighteenth-century duc de Lévis claimed that his family descended from the biblical Levi.

7. the Hospitaller order: Several orders of nuns were described as hospitalières, that is, dedicated to the care of the sick.

### 2.6.7: A Few Silhouettes in the Shadows
1. Marguerite de Blemeur: a seventeenth-century (1618–96) nun and scholar who wrote the Lives of the Saints of the Order of Saint Benedict.

2. the Dacier of the Order: its scholar, Anne Dacier (1647–1720), was an accomplished woman of letters who translated classical authors from Sappho and Aristophanes to Plautus and Terence.

3. Mademoiselle Gauvain … Mademoiselle de Siguenza: Several of the names Hugo gives here have resonance in his own life. Gauvain, for example, was the real family name of his longtime mistress, Juliette Drouet. Cogolludo, Cifuentes, and Siguenza were fiefs granted to Hugo’s father by Joseph Bonaparte in Spain; Miltière and Laudinière were properties purchased by General Hugo under the Restoration; Auverné near Nantes was the birthplace of Hugo’s mother, Sophie Trébuchet.

4. the Isle of Bourbon … Roze: Réunion, in the Indian Ocean, now an overseas department (Département d’Outre-Mer, DOM) of France. The chevalier Roze was Nicolas Roger Roze (1675–1733), who worked heroically to alleviate the conditions in Marseilles during the plague of 1720.

### 2.6.8: Post Corda Lapides
1. Post corda lapides: “After the hearts, the stones.”

2. a jeu de paume … “eleven thousand devils”: The jeu de paume (predecessor of the tennis court) was another landmark on the left bank near the convent of the rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève.

### 2.6.9: A Century Under a Wimple
1. the abbey of Fontevrault: sometimes Fontevraud, an unusual abbey that was both a monastery and a nunnery. The Plantagenets supported the abbey, and several members of the family—Henry II, Eleanor of Aquitaine, and Richard the Lion-Hearted—are buried there. It was turned into a prison in 1804.

2. Monsieur de Miromesnil: Armand-Thomas Hue de Miromesnil (1723–96), keeper of the seals for most of the reign of Louis XVI (1774–87).

3. the Bernardines were right up there: a reference to the great age of libertinage in the eighteenth century; the implication is that Bernardine monks of aristocratic origin were as elegant and worldly as young officers of the musketeers. While the abbé mondain is a common literary and historical figure of the Enlightenment, it is unusual to see monks described in this way.

4. giving Molière an idea: It is not clear what play Hugo might be referring to, but farces about lovers’ misunderstandings are not unusual in Molière’s work.

### 2.6.10: Origins of Perpetual Adoration
1. In 1649, the Blessed Sacrament … with this pious aim: Hugo seems to have invented the incident involving the desecration of the Eucharist, but he has once again used real people in his fictional creation. Catherine de Bar (1614–98), known as Mother Mechthilde du Saint-Sacrement, was a well known, influential abbess in the seventeenth century. She did in fact found a convent dedicated to the adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, in the rue du Bac, in 1653. The comtesse de Châteauvieux was a friend and supporter of Mother Mechthilde.

### 2.6.11: End of the Petit-Picpus
1. Volaverunt: “They have flown away.”

2. Julia Alpinula: the inscription of a tombstone found in a Roman excavation in Switzerland: “Here I lie, I lived for twenty-three years.”

3. Joseph de Maistre … Voltaire: Joseph de Maistre (see here) was as devoted to orthodox Catholicism as he was to absolute monarchy; Voltaire’s hostility to the Catholic Church was legendary.

4. Calas: The affaire Calas was a criminal trial in which a Protestant, Jean Calas, was convicted of the murder of his son in spite of inconclusive evidence. In Toulouse, where relations between Catholics and Protestants remained hostile well into the nineteenth century, Calas was suspected of having wanted to stop his son from converting to Catholicism. Calas was executed in 1762, but Voltaire was able to have his conviction posthumously overturned three years later.

## Book 7: A Parenthesis
1. A Parenthesis: Yves Gohin notes that Hugo’s Belgian publisher, Lacroix, asked him to delete this section from the novel, which was growing to an alarming length. Hugo at first agreed, then protested, “I cannot introduce a convent into Les Misérables only to praise it. There must be some reservations.”

### 2.7.1: The Convent as an Abstract Idea
1. the infinite: The idea of the infinite, l’infini—the limitless nature of the sky, the ocean, God, love, hate, the natural world—fascinated the Romantics.

2. a hideous side … and a sublime side: an apparent allusion to Hugo’s theory of the grotesque, his fascination with the duality of laideur (ugliness) and beauté in a single person, feeling, or entity. Hugo elaborated on his idea of the grotesque in the preface to his play Cromwell; the play is in fact remembered because of the preface. The best-known example is probably Quasimodo of Notre-Dame de Paris, whose hideous physical appearance hides the sublime and infinite love he bears for Esmeralda. see here, where the image of the bleeding Christ is described as “hideous and magnificent.”

### 2.7.2: The Convent as Historical Fact
1. what mistletoe is to oak: Mistletoe is a parasite on oak.

2. seraphim: the highest order of angels, who live in the presence of God.

3. a whiff of the East: French and European writers of the Romantic era, indeed the entire nineteenth century, were fascinated by the “Orient.” The references in this paragraph to the aga khan of heaven, the seraglio (the harem), the odalisque, and the eunuch are all manifestations of this exotic imagining of the East.

4. aga khan of heaven: The aga khan was the ruler of the Ismalian sect of Muslims; here the reference is more vaguely meant to indicate a Muslim equivalent of an archbishop.

5. seraglio: In the harem, or seraglio, the odalisques (concubines) of the sultan were guarded by eunuchs.

6. The in pace replaced the leather bag: The in pace is a cell used as a means of discipline in convents. The “leather bag” refers to the legendary means of execution favoured by Ottoman sultans, in this case for adulterous wives or insolent concubines: The victim was sewn into a leather bag and thrown, alive, into the waters of the Bosporus.

7. Jean-Jacques: Rousseau’s last name was not necessary, especially for those who saw him as a virtual prophet, as did many Romantics.

8. Diderot: Denis Diderot (see here), with Voltaire and Rousseau, is considered the greatest of the philosophes. He is best known for directing and editing the Encyclopédie and writing novels such as Jacques the Fatalist and His Master, Rameau’s Nephew, and the scandalous, posthumously published The Nun.

9. Voltaire on Calas, Labarre, and Sirven: As in the affaire Calas (see here), Jacques de Labarre and the Protestant Sirvens were convicted of crimes before Voltaire took up their cause. At the age of sixteen, the chevalier de Labarre (1746–66) was accused of blasphemy for the desecration of a statue of the Virgin Mary. He was condemned to have his hand cut off and his tongue cut out before being burned at the stake; on appeal the sentence was reduced to simple decapitation. Voltaire (among others) fought in vain to stop his execution, which was the last for a charge of blasphemy under the ancien régime. The Sirvens, husband and wife, were accused of murdering their daughter in order to prevent her from converting to Catholicism. In this case, the couple fled to Switzerland before being arrested and were condemned to death in absentia. Voltaire succeeded in his efforts to have their sentence overturned.

10. Tacitus, too … “that poor Holofernes”: The works of the Roman senator and historian Tacitus (ca. 56–117) chronicled the lives of five Caesars, including Nero. In the book of Judith, in the Catholic Old Testament (excluded by the Protestant and Jewish canons), Holofernes was the Assyrian general sent by Nebuchadnezzar to subdue the rebellious Jerusalem. As his armies starved the city by siege, the beautiful and pious widow Judith made her way to his tent, seduced him, and gave him wine until he fell asleep, at which point she cut off his head, which she carried back to Jerusalem in triumph. The story of Judith and Holofernes inspired painters from Rembrandt to Klimt and several operas.

11. oubliettes: these cells evocatively derive their name from the French verb oublier, “to forget.”

### 2.7.3: On What Conditions We Can Respect the Past
1. put the handles back on the aspersoria and the sabres: Aspersoria are vessels made to carry holy water. Paired with sabres, the image suggests forced conversions to Christianity in early medieval Europe.

2. Haruspices: Haruspices were Etruscan, and later Roman, priests who specialized in reading the entrails of sacrificed animals.

3. Bos cretatus: a reference to the satires of Juvenal, in which the author mocks the superficial religious practices of his contemporaries. If a white bull was required for sacrifice but unavailable, a bull of some other colour was simply whitened with chalk.

4. the city of 1789, of 1830, of 1848: the French revolutions that toppled, respectively, Louis XVI and the ancien régime, Charles X and the Charter of 1815, and finally Louis-Philippe and the July Monarchy.

5. fakirs, bonzes … talapoins, and dervishes: Muslim, Hindu, and Eastern Orthodox clerics are lumped together in a scornful comparison to those living in Catholic cloisters.

### 2.7.6: Absolute Goodness of Prayer
1. Marcus Aurelius: (121–180) Roman emperor (from 161 until his death) and stoic philosopher, author of the Meditations.

2. lyceum: Aristotle’s school in Athens. The French word lycée, secondary school, is derived from “lyceum.”

### 2.7.7: Precautions to Take in Laying Blame
1. Caiaphas as bishop … Tiberius as emperor: Caiaphus was the high priest of Jerusalem at the time of Christ’s trial; he continued to persecute early Christians after the Crucifixion. Draco, the Athenian ruler (seventh century B.C.E.), is remembered as the creator of unreasonably harsh laws. The adjective draconian derives from his name. Trimalcion was from the Satyricon of the first-century Roman author Petronius; Trimalcion, or Trimalchio, is a pompous nouveau riche Roman who flaunts his wealth and his shallow understanding of literature and philosophy. Trimalcion as “lawmaker” or legislator recalls the senator of Part One, and would have had great resonance for readers of France under the July Monarchy and the Second Empire. Tiberius (42 B.C.E.–A.D. 37) succeeded Caesar Augustus as Roman emperor (14–37). His reign was marked by the execution of political enemies and legendary debauchery on the island of Capri.

2. Cenobitism: i.e., those living in cloistered religious communities.

### 2.7.8: Faith, Law
1. Thales: Thales of Miletus (ca. 624–546 B.C.E.); a pre-Socratic philospher regarded as the founder of the Greek schools of philosophy and science.

2. The abbé of La Trappe … Horace’s lines with him: the abbey of La Trappe became famous for its strict of observance of the Cistercian rule. A philosophical fatalism unites the austere monk of La Trappe with the poet of first-century Rome.

3. Leibniz at prayer … Voltaire at worship: The German mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716) was a rationalist and firm believer in God. In Candide (1756), Voltaire made Dr. Pangloss the satirically reductive voice of Leibniz’s philosophical optimism in “this the best of all possible worlds.” The deist Voltaire believed in the “watchmaker god” who had created a brilliant machine but was indifferent to its operations, including prayer.

4. Deo erexit Voltaire: “A monument to God, erected by Voltaire,” the inscription on the church Voltaire had built in the village of Ferney (see here). Whatever his hostility to politicized religious institutions such as the Catholic Church (the object of his legendary motto “Écrasez l’Infame,” “Crush the Infamous One”), he believed that religion was necessary to provide moral guidance to the masses. He also promoted such cottage industries as pottery and watchmaking in Ferney, as work was also necessary to social order. It is worth noting that Voltaire’s church is dedicated to God, not to any religion or saint.

## Book 8: Cemeteries Take What They are Given
### 2.8.1: In Which the Way to Enter a Convent Is Dealt With
1. a tabellion: A tabellion was a sort of copy clerk who made and preserved copies of important legal documents for attorneys. Fauchelevent’s oft-referenced illiteracy should be understood as ignorance rather than an inability to read; he was unlettered rather than illiterate.

### 2.8.3: Mother Innocent
1. “Dom Mabillon” … “Me neither”: Dom Mabillon (1623–1707), a Benedictine monk and scholar, author of The Lives of the Benedictine Saints. We will not follow Mother Innocent through all twists and turns of her erudition, which, though Hugo gently mocks it, was his own as well. Yves Gohin attributes this scene to Hugo’s love of reading dictionaries, in this case Louis Moreri’s Catholic Encyclopaedia, first published in 1649. Several of the authorities and examples Mother Innocent cites are erroneous or simply inventions of Hugo’s. Old man Fauchelevent’s uncomprehending goodwill (“Me neither”) toward Merlonus Horstius confirms Hugo’s lighthearted touch in this scene, in which one can see the hand of Hugo the playwright.

2. “a Jansenist, Madame de Béthune”: The ducal Béthune family descended from the family of Sully, the great minister of Henri IV. The Jansenists were Catholic reformers who believed in austerity and predestination. The movement was ferociously opposed by the Vatican, the powerful Jesuits, and Louis XIV. Largely stamped out in the early eighteenth century, Jansenism continued to trouble the religious and political establishment for many years.

3. “Hanc igitur oblationem”: “With this sacrifice.” In the Catholic Church, these words begin the prayer with which the officiant presents the host, the body of Christ.

4. “the emp—Buonaparte”: Father Fauchelevent is careful to use the appropriate language to describe the usurper.

5. “Stat crux dum volvitur orbis”: “The cross remains standing as the world turns.”

6. “he brought down Abelard at the Council of Sens”: In a celebrated theological quarrel, the scholar and theologian Pierre Abelard (1079–1142), best remembered as the lover of Héloïse, debated the more orthodox Bernard of Clairvaux before a Church tribunal at Sens. The council ruled in favour of Bernard and condemned Abelard as a heretic.

7. “King Louis the Young”: i.e., Louis VII, born 1120, reigned 1137–1180.

8. “Eugenius III”: pope from 1145 to 1153, he gave the Knights Templar—i.e., the Temple—an official status in the Church and sponsored the Second Crusade.

9. “Monte Cassino”: the site of Saint Benedict’s first abbey; see here.

10. “the Basil of the West”: Basil of Caesarea, or Saint Basil the Great (ca. 330–79), one of the fathers of the Eastern and Roman churches.

11. “the Huguenot king Henri IV”: Mother Innocent, after more than two hundred years, seems suspicious of the sincerity of Henri IV’s conversion (see here). Henri’s confessor, Father Coton, persuaded the earthy Béarnais to refrain from using blasphemous expletives, at least in the priest’s presence.

12. “Martin of Tours”: Saint Martin of Tours (ca. 316–97), the first Christian bishop of Tours and an influential figure in the early Church. While serving as an officer in the Roman cavalry, Martin came upon a beggar shivering in the cold. He cut his cloak in half and gave half to the beggar. That night he had a dream of Jesus wearing his cloak, and when he awoke his cloak was whole again. Martin declared himself a soldier of Christ, quit the army, and took holy orders.

### 2.8.4: In Which Jean Valjean Looks as Though He Has Read Austin Castillejo
1. If the monk Austin Castillejo … get her out again: At the height of his power, Charles V (1500–58), Holy Roman Emperor (1530–58) and King of Spain (1516–56), controlled Austria and much of Germany, the Low Countries, the Franche-Comté, much of Italy, and the Spanish possessions in the Americas. After his abdication in 1556 due to ill health—his Spanish possessions went to his son, Philip II of Spain, his German titles to his brother—Charles lived at the Spanish monastery of San Yuste, near Extremadura, Spain. The anecdote about a mistress named La Plombes, as well as its source, Austin Castillejo, are inventions of Hugo.

### 2.8.5: It’s Not Enough to Be a Drunk to Be Immortal
1. the dome of the Invalides: i.e., the golden dome of the Hôtel des Invalides.

2. Montparnasse Cemetery: a small cemetery near today’s Montparnasse train station, much smaller than the sprawling Père-Lachaise on the eastern edge of the city.

3. “For the philosophers … the Supreme Being”: The deist philosophes described God in non-Christian terms, as did Robespierre, who invented the cult of the Supreme Being, l’Être suprême, to combat the atheism of certain revolutionaries while remaining distinct from the Catholic Church.

4. “You’re a peasant, I’m a Parisian”: In French, especially in the nineteenth century, peasant (paysan) had less of a class connotation than simply meaning someone from the country, though the Parisian gravedigger is certainly supercilious.

5. “a porter at the Prytanée”: A Jesuit college in the town of La Flèche from 1604, the Prytanée school became a military school in 1762, was closed during the Revolution and reopened by Napoléon. The gravedigger’s father must have been an ambitious doorman to have had money to lose in the stock market.

6. “cooks in the Croix-Rouge”: i.e., the servants of the neighbourhood known as the Croix-Rouge, just west of the church of Saint-Sulpice.

### 2.8.6: Between Four Planks
1. “Qui dormiunt … semper”: the call of the priest and the response of the altar boy constituting the Latin burial rite of the Catholic Church: “Those who sleep in the dirt shall awaken, some in eternal life, some in shame that they shall see forever.”

2. “De profundis”: “From the depths,” Psalm 130: “From the depths I cried out to you, O Lord.”

3. “Requiem … Domine”: “Give him eternal rest, O Lord.”

4. “Et lux … ei”: “And let an eternal light illuminate him.”

5. “Requiescat in pace”: “Rest in peace.”

### 2.8.8: A Successful Interrogation
1. Monsieur de Latil … brother to the king: Before his brother Louis XVIII died, making him Charles X, the Comte d’Artois was known as “Monsieur,” according to the Bourbon tradition. As his confessor, Jean-Baptiste de Latil (1761–1839) was promoted by the new king to the archbishopric of Rheims just in time to officiate at the coronation.

2. Leo XII: Annibale della Genga succeeded Pius VII as pope in 1823.

### 2.8.9: Enclosure
1. royalist paper money of ’93: Anti-revolutionary activity was particularly strong in the west of France, in Bretagne and the Vendée region, which gave its name to the movement and its military forces, the Vendéens, or, as they called themselves, l’Armée Catholique et Royale de la France. Jean Nicolas Stofflet (1753–96), one of the leaders of the Vendéen movement, was captured and shot by government troops in 1796.

2.

image
3. assignat from La Vendée: The Vendéens issued assignats, paper money, in imitation of the Revolutionary government. Revolutionary assignats devalued quickly and those of the Vendée even faster.

4. the Chouan party: Allies of the Vendéens, the Chouan rebels took their name from the word for owl in the Breton dialect. Beginning in 1791, Chouan insurgents began a guerrilla war against the government. They outlasted the Vendéens, making a last effort at insurrection as late as 1799. Hugo’s last novel, Ninety-three, tells the story of a Chouan faction at war with the armies of the Convention.

5. lacerated by discipline: i.e., by the scourge with which certain religious practised self-mortification.

# Part 3: Marius
## Book 1: Paris Studied Down to Its Minutest Atom
### 3.1.1: Parvulus
1. Parvulus: Latin for child.

2. Homuncio: little man. Plautus was a Roman playwright of the third century B.C.E. whose comedies are a frequent point of reference in Les Misérables (see especially page 487 and see here).

### 3.1.2: A Few of His Distinguishing Marks
1. dwarf: In royal and princely courts of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, dwarves were frequently employed as fools or jesters and, according to classical tradition, used their status to point out the foibles of the mighty, as with Shakespeare’s fool in King Lear. The dwarf-jester Triboulet is the protagonist of Hugo’s play Le Roi s’amuse (The King Takes His Pleasure), which inspired Verdi’s Rigoletto.

2. cherub of the gutter: For French readers, especially in Hugo’s time, cherub, chérubin, had a double meaning: not only the Cupid-like angel but also the insolent, Puck-like character in Beaumarchais’ Mariage de Figaro.

3. fiacres: one-horse hansom cabs that took their name from the place Saint-Fiacre, thought to be the place where the first carriages for hire were found.

4. his fabulous monster: According to Yves Gohin, this monster is a memory of Hugo’s childhood, when he and his brother Eugène would frighten each other with tales of a monster who lived in the well of their house.

5. Talleyrand: The celebrated diplomat (see here) was as well known for his sharp wit in society as for his unscrupulous survival skills in politics.

### 3.1.3: He Is Nice
1. Mademoiselle Mars: see here.

2. De Profundis to carnival numbers: i.e., from religious hymns to bawdy ditties. Carnival, culminating in Mardi Gras, was celebrated with much more fervour in the nineteenth century, just as Lent was observed more scrupulously.

3. Rabelais: see here.

4. Adamastor: a monster imagined by the sixteenth-century Portuguese poet Luíz Vaz de Camões as a metaphor for the dangers of seafaring.

### 3.1.4: He Can Be Useful
1. Prudhomme and Fouillou: not specific people but personifications of two types: Prudhomme, from “prudent man” (see here), the cautious, complacent, and self-satisfied man so typical of the French bourgeoisie of the July Monarchy and the Second Empire, and Fouillou, from the verb fouiller, “to search” or “to dig,” the resourceful and self-reliant—sometimes slippery—type, like Figaro.

2. an Ionian or a Boeotian: The Ionians, in modern-day Turkey, and the Boeotians (i.e., the Thebans) revolted against the Persian Empire in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.E.

### 3.1.5: His Boundaries
1. Urbis amator … like Flaccus: urbis amator, one who loves the city; ruris amator, one who loves the country. An allusion to the Epistles of Horace, specifically a letter the poet (Quintus Horatius Flaccus) wrote to a friend, Fuscus, in Rome.

2. Glacière, Cunette … the Pierre-Plate de Châtillon: As with the list of suburban villages at the end of the chapter, many of these sites can still be seen on a map of Paris and its outskirts. Of special note is the “hideous Grenelle wall riddled with bullet holes.” The mur de Grenelle—a since-demolished vestige of the medieval defensive wall—was the site of military executions by firing squad. Besides Hugo’s lifelong abhorrence of the death penalty, this was the site and method of execution of General Lahorie, Hugo’s godfather and his mother’s lover, convicted of plotting against Napoléon in 1812.

3. Ivry, Gentilly … Gonesse: Many of these suburbs have since been absorbed into the municipality of Paris itself.

### 3.1.6: A Bit of History
1. “the swallows of the pont d’Arcole”: a real group of homeless children who lived under the bridge and foraged through Paris like Fagin’s gang in the 1850s.

2. Louis XIV … naval fleet: The Sun King wanted a fleet to compete with the trading and exploration of the Spanish, Dutch, and English; his great minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619–83) built it for him.

3. intendants and the parliaments: the royal administrators and law courts of the various provinces and cities of France.

4. Barbier: Edmond-Jean-François Barbier (1689–1771), a Parisian lawyer and diarist whose Journal bears witness to Parisian life for almost fifty years, from 1718 to 1763.

### 3.1.7: The Gamin Would Have His Place in the Caste System of India
1. a little work entitled Claude Gueux: Claude Gueux was in fact an 1834 novel by Hugo himself. He had already used the word gamin in Notre-Dame de Paris; it is quite possible he forgot in the thirty-year interval between that novel and Les Misérables.

2. No festival comes near La Grève: Executions were performed in the place de Grève until 1830.

3. Sanson and the abbé Montès: The Sanson family were the chief executioners in Paris from 1688 to 1847, the office passing from father to son. The abbé Montès was the chief almoner for the prisons of Paris under the Restoration and the July Monarchy.

4. Lacenaire … Debacker: Like the rest of the criminals named in this chapter, Lacenaire was a real person. Pierre François Lacenaire (1803–36) was the well-educated son of a prosperous merchant in Lyon; arrested for two murders—and a third that he had attempted—Lacenaire managed to make himself a celebrity in prison, writing poetry and his memoirs before his execution was carried out. Hugo would have been thirteen when he saw Dautun executed for the murder of his brother in 1816 (see here). Papavoine was executed for murdering two children in the Bois de Vincennes. Tolleron was one of those executed in an 1816 plot to blow up the Tuileries Palace. Avril was Lacenaire’s friend and accomplice. Louvel assassinated the duc de Berry in 1820 (see here). Delaporte was a highwayman executed in 1824; Castaing (1793–1824) murdered two of his friends in order to inherit their fortunes. Bories was one of four soldiers condemned to death for plotting a republican coup in the plot of the “Sergents de Rochelle.” Jean-Martin is a mistaken reference to Paul-Louis Martin, who was beheaded for murdering his father in 1820. Madame Lecouffé pushed her son to murder an old lady so that they could rob her. Castaing, Bories, Martin, Dautun, and Papavoine were mentioned in Hugo’s Last Day of a Condemned Man. The details of the criminal named Debacker are elusive.

5. To be left-handed: According to an old European superstition, the left hand was associated with the devil, the right with God.

### 3.1.8: In Which You Will Read a Delightful Saying of the King’s
1. the boats of washerwomen: Laundresses worked on rafts anchored on the Seine, to take advantage of the flowing water.

2. Eleusinian lamentations of the Panathenaea: The Panathenaea was a festival in ancient Athens that included song and poetry contests and, every fourth year, competitive games. The Eleusinians were associated with the cult of Demeter and Persephone. Evoe was an invocation to the wine god Bacchus, used in orgies and celebrations.

3. From 1815 to 1830 … pears on walls: The turkeys are caricatures of the Bourbons Louis XVIII and Charles X, while Louis-Philippe was mocked for his pear-shaped head.

4. a gold louis … “The pear’s on that, too”: i.e., the royal profile on the twenty-franc coin.

5. curés: literally curates, but used as a catchall term for priests.

6. rue de l’Université: one of the main streets of the elegant faubourg Saint-Germain.

7. Tantalus: see here.

8. the Pont-Neuf: the oldest existing bridge in Paris, on the western tip of the Île de la Cité.

### 3.1.9: The Old Soul of Gaul
1. Poquelin, son of Les Halles: Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, known as Molière (see here), was the son of a prosperous upholsterer in the commercial district around Les Halles; he was baptized in the Saint-Eustache church, with the young king Louis XIV as his godfather.

2. Beaumarchais: Pierre-Caron de Beaumarchais (1732–99) was both the creator and alter ego of Figaro, the hero of The Barber of Seville and The Marriage of Figaro.

3. Camille Desmoulins: Beginning his career with public harangues in the garden of the Palais-Royal, Desmoulins (1760–94) became one of the most ardent revolutionaries, serving as Danton’s secretary in the first republican government in 1792. Desmoulins was appalled by the excesses of the Terror and became a critic of Robespierre, which proved fatal. He was guillotined along with Danton in April 1794.

4. Championnet: Jean-Étienne Championnet (1762–1800) rose from simple soldier to general in less than ten years. “Flooded the porticoes” of churches is Hugo’s insolent—gaminesque—allusion to a verse of Racine’s Athalie, in which the phrase is used, obviously in a quite different sense. As commander of the army that took Naples in 1798, Championnet persuaded the archbishop to celebrate the miracle of Saint Januarius (San Gennaro), in which the prelate holds up a vial of the saint’s dried blood and declares that it has turned back to liquid.

5. the Theban boy: an apparent reference to Hercules, whose mother was the wife of the king of Thebes and who killed the Nemean lion as a youth and wore the skin as a trophy for the rest of his life.

6. the drummer Barra: Joseph Barra or Bara (1780–93), a legendary martyr of the Republic, was killed by Chouan troops in 1793 after he refused to say “Vive le roi” and instead cried out “Vive la République!” Robespierre quickly adopted the boy’s death as a symbol of republican devotion and royalist brutality.

7. the warhorse in the Scriptures: Job 39:19–22: “Do you give the horse his strength and endow his neck with splendour? … He laughs at fear.”

### 3.1.10: Ecce Paris, Ecce Homo
1. Ecce Paris, Ecce Homo: “Behold Paris, Behold the Man”; an echo of John 19:5: “And Pilate said unto them, Behold the man!”

2. graeculus of Rome: graeculus means “little Greek.”

3. Paris has its Capitol … the Panthéon: Hugo believed that Paris was the heir to Rome, as Rome had been heir to Athens, the centre of the civilized world. His comparison begins at the top of the political and social order, by directly comparing the symbols of the government (the Capitol and the Hôtel de Ville), of religion (the Parthenon and Notre-Dame), etc. The Sorbonne is apparently set apart for satire, as an Asinarium, or donkey shed, the “house of asses.” Hugo descends from the highest to the lowest aspects of Parisian society and compares the city to the Rome he knew from his readings of classical texts, especially Plautus, whose comedies provide many of the characters in Hugo’s long comparison. Only those citations that have some broader echo in Les Misérables or Hugo’s life and work are explained here.

4. Rameau’s nephew and Curculion the parasite: In Diderot’s novel Le Neveu de Rameau, the nephew of the great eighteenth-century composer is presented as a philosophical observer of French society as he survives on the invitations and sometimes reluctant generosity of friends and acquaintances. Curculion the Parasite is a Roman social type from Plautus.

5. Café Anglais: in the boulevard des Italiens, a centre of fashionable nightlife for most of the nineteenth century.

6. Quis … pallio: From Plautus’ play Epidicus: “Who stops me in my path, taking me by the cloak.”

7. Mademoiselle Lenormand: Marie Anne Adelaide Lenormand (1772–1843) was a famous fortune-teller in Paris.

8. séances: Fascinated by the supernatural (and haunted by the death of his favourite daughter, Léopoldine, in 1843), Hugo participated in séances at Hauteville House in Jersey.

9. puts a grisette on the throne: a reference to Madame du Barry, who was a prostitute before being elevated to the rank of royal mistress.

10. Messalina: The legendary sexual appetites and adventures of Claudius’ empress fascinated Hugo, among others.

11. Contra … oblivisci: “Against the Gracchi, we have the Tiber. To drink from the Tiber is to forget sedition.”

12. Tartuffe’s posturing … Priapus’ “hiccups”: Tartuffe, the sanctimonious hypocrite who lusts for his benefactor’s wife, was one of Molière’s most enduring characters; Priapus, the Greco-Roman god of male fertility, often incarnated male lustiness in popular Roman literature and theatre.

13. David d’Angers, Balzac, and Charlet: The sculptor David d’Angers, the novelist Honoré de Balzac, and the painter and engraver Nicolas-Toussaint Charlet all used contemporary Paris and Parisians as the subjects of their work. Hugo delivered Balzac’s eulogy at the Père-Lachaise cemetery in 1850.

### 3.1.11: Railing, Reigning
1. “To please you, O Athenians!” cried Alexander: The source of this quote, apparently referring to the Macedonian Alexander’s conquest of Athens, is unclear.

2. the Tennis Court Oath: the celebrated moment of June 20, 1789, when the deputies of the Third Estate declared themselves the representatives of the French nation and vowed that they would not disband until they had established a constitution for France. Within a few days, Louis XVI recognized the former Estates General, with its divisions of the nobility, the clergy, and the common people, as the National Assembly. The ancien régime was legally a thing of the past.

3. night of August 4: a dramatic session of the National Assembly on August 4, 1789, when the deputies abolished all fiscal and social privileges of the nobility.

4. Washington … Garibaldi: From George Washington to Giuseppe Garibaldi, who as Hugo wrote was working to unify Italy, these men were heroes of nineteenth-century liberalism: Tadeusz Kościuszko (1746–1817) fought in the American Revolution before returning to his native Poland to lead an unsuccessful revolt against Russian rule; Kościuszko died in exile. Simon Bolívar was the great hero of South American independence from Spain. Markos Botzaris (1788–1823) was a leader of the Greek revolt against Ottoman rule. Rafael del Riego (1784–1823) was a leader of the liberal revolt against the king of Spain in 1822. Manin (1804–57) was a leader of the Risorgimento and early advocate of Italian nationalism. Carlos Antonio López (1796–1867) was the first president of Paraguay. Hugo considered the Abolitionist John Brown a hero and martyr. The persons and places named in these passages relate to the movements for independence and liberalism, often republicanism, in Europe (Greece, Italy, Spain, and Hungary) and across South America in the nineteenth century.

5. Boston in 1779 … Palermo in 1860: Just as Boston is the cradle of American liberty, the other cities and sites named represent republican and independence movements across Europe in the nineteenth century. “Pest in 1848” refers to the Hungarian uprising against the Hapsburgs. The island of St. Léon was a stronghold for the liberal Spanish insurgents in 1820. In Palermo in 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi led an uprising against the reactionary Bourbon rulers of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

6. Byron dies at Missolonghi: Lord Byron travelled to Greece in 1824 to join the fight for independence, but died of a fever and subsequent bleedings before he could join in combat.

7. Mazet dies in Barcelona: Dr. Mazet was one of a group of French physicians who travelled to Barcelona in 1821 in order to study and help fight an epidemic of yellow fever; Mazet died after contracting the disease himself. Hugo’s 1822 poem “Le Dévouement” was inspired by Mazet and the other members of the humanitarian expedition.

8. Mirabeau’s feet … Robespierre: After a decidedly ambiguous early life, Honoré-Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, became one of the heroes of the Revolution due to his powerful speeches to the National Assembly. Robespierre was doomed when he became tyrant in the name of republicanism.

9. Pascal … Molière: In Hugo’s view, the poets, writers, and thinkers who sought to enlighten (see here) their readers were the true priests of humanity.

10. Bouginier’s nose … Crédéville is a thief: two popular instances of Parisian graffiti that took on lives of their own as the French travelled through Europe. Legend has it that “Crédéville voleur” is in fact written at the top of an Egyptian pyramid.

11. Montesquieu … Danton: A chronological list of the writers who over the course of the eighteenth century made it possible for Danton to act on his daring. Montesquieu’s (1689–1755) L’Esprit des lois (On the Spirit of Laws) is one of the founding documents of the Enlightenment and of modern political science. The mathematician marquis de Condorcet (1749–94), called the last of the philosophes, joined the (relatively) moderate Girondin faction in the Convention. Arouet is Voltaire’s real name.

12. “Daring!” is a fiat lux: Danton rallied the Convention and the Parisian populace to a war footing in 1792, as German and French royalist troops prepared to cross the Rhine, with a passionate speech calling for courageous daring: “De l’audace, encore de l’audace et toujours de l’audace!” Fiat lux refers to the first chapter of Genesis: “Let there be light!”

13. the torch of Prometheus to Cambronne’s stunted pipe: Prometheus brought fire, and thus light (enlightenment), to mortals; in Hugo’s view, Cambronne’s refusal to surrender (“Merde!”) was a stand against the governments represented by the armies in the field.

### 3.1.12: The Future Latent in the People
1. Fex urbis, cries Cicero: i.e., the dregs of the city.

2. mob, adds Burke: The conservative, traditionalist Edmund Burke supported American independence but was resolutely hostile to the French Revolution.

### 3.1.13: Petit-Gavroche
1. About eight or nine years: thus, in 1831 or 1832. The July Revolution has in the interim deposed the Bourbons in favour of a new government and new constitution under Louis-Philippe d’Orléans.

2. the boulevard, the Cirque, the Porte Saint-Martin: Gavroche, the theatregoer, cab fetcher, and errand runner, haunts the elegant district of theatres like the Porte Saint-Martin and the Cirque around the grands boulevards on the right bank.

## Book 2: The Grand Bourgeois
### 3.2.1: Ninety Years Old and All Thirty-two Teeth
1. the Temple: The onetime fortress of the Knights Templar, the Temple was part of the Marais neighbourhood, as was the place des Vosges, home of the Hugo family from 1832 to 1848 and today the site of the Victor Hugo Museum. The last remnants of the Temple were destroyed over the course of the nineteenth century.

2. the new Tivoli quartier: Also called the quartier de l’Europe, for the place de l’Europe, the name Tivoli comes from the Tivoli Gardens, which once occupied the area around today’s Gare Saint-Lazare.

3. a true and complete bourgeois: the grande bourgeoisie, the wealthy Parisians who lived off private fortunes and were quite content, in the idealized case of Monsieur Gillenormand, with their status in the Second Order.

4. a sensible fellow and Nature: With sensibilité and Nature, some of the vocabulary, if not the spirit, of Rousseau seems to have entered into Monsieur Gillenormand’s vocabulary.

5. “The Opéra danseuses are rose-pink cannibals”: the image of dancers, who were, like actresses, considered part of the demimonde. The verb manger, “to eat,” was used to describe the way they devoured their lovers’ fortunes, a literary tradition that ran from Manon Lescaut to Zola’s Nana. Monsieur Gillenormand longs to be their victim once again.

6. “The Caribbeans”: from the indigenous tribe that inhabited the islands of the Caribbean Sea; i.e., the “natives” or “savages” of European imagination.

### 3.2.2: Like Master, Like Abode
1. a boudoir: not, as is often thought, a bedroom, but a small sitting room, traditionally the site of adulterous assignations. Boudoirs are usually associated with women.

2. Monsieur de Vivonne: The duc de Vivonne, later duc de Rochechouart, was a great favourite of Louis XIV, who made him Général des Galères, essentially head of the French navy, because of both his military service and the fact that he was the brother of the royal mistress, Madame de Montespan.

3. the man of the court … and the man of the robe: a distinction between the noblesse de cour, or d’épée, and the noblesse de robe, the class of magistrates whose offices could be purchased until 1789. Before dedicating his fortune to the acquisition. of mistresses, Monsieur Gillenormand could easily have purchased the second sort of nobility, but he is proud of his own place in the bygone social order.

4. Jordaens: Jacob Jordaens, a seventeenth-century Flemish painter.

5. the Incroyables: Also called muscadins, the Incroyables were the male counterpart of the merveilleuses, whose number included Joséphine de Beauharnais, part of an extravagant and debauched high society that flourished after the fall of the puritanical Robespierre.

### 3.2.3: Luc-Esprit
1. La Camargo and La Sallé: Marie-Anne Camargo (1710–70) and Marie Sallé (1707–56) were dancers at the Opéra. Voltaire wrote an ode to them that began: “Ah! Camargo, que vous êtes brillante! / Mais que Sallé, grands Dieux, est ravissante!”

2. Guimard: Marie-Madeleine Guimard (1743–1816), known simply as La Guimard, was one of the most celebrated danseuses-courtisanes of the eighteenth century, whose lovers included the prince de Soubise and the bishop of Orléans.

3. Longchamp: The racetrack at Longchamp was a gathering place for high society from the mid-1750s on.

4. Madame de Boufflers: Both the marquise de Boufflers and her cousin by marriage, the comtesse de Boufflers, were leading figures in Parisian high society in the late eighteenth century.

5. Corbière! Humann! Casimir Périer!: Jacques-Joseph de Corbière was the son of a carpenter who became minister of the interior from 1821 to 1824; Georges Humann was, like Casimir Périer (see here), a banker and politician; Humann served as minister of finance several times under the July Monarchy, the first time in 1832. For the old-fashioned Monsieur Gillenormand, a bourgeois minister is a ludicrous notion.

6. Luc-Esprit: i.e., Saint Luke the Evangelist, and esprit, “spirit,” as in Saint-Esprit, the Holy Spirit. Esprit also means “wit,” especially in the libertine eighteenth century so dear to Monsieur Gillenormand.

### 3.2.4: An Aspiring Centenarian
1. duc de Nivernais … duc de Nevers: Louis-Jules Mancini-Mazarini (1716–98), the last duc de Nivernais, was the grandson of the duc de Nevers. Monsieur Gillenormand apparently finds the older title more impressive.

2. “blue sash”: the cordon bleu of the Order of the Saint-Esprit, the highest heraldic decoration of the French monarchy.

3. Catherine II: In spite of her reputation as an “enlightened despot,” Catherine the Great participated in the partitioning of Poland in 1772 and 1792 and the final absorption of Poland into Russia, Prussia, and Austria in 1795.

4. “Bestuchef’s yellow dye … Lamotte’s drops”: the “gold elixir from Bestuchef” and “Lamotte’s drops” were believed to be cures for the “catastrophes of love,” i.e., venereal disease.

### 3.2.5: Basque and Nicolette
1. “by turning … into an annuity”: i.e., he purchased a life annuity, a rente viagère, that would last his lifetime but leave very little for his heirs.

2. “national property”: Beginning in 1790, the properties of émigrés, the Catholic Church, and eventually anyone accused of betraying the nation were confiscated and sold to provide revenue for the state.

3. tiers consolidé: In 1797, the Directory government, faced with a huge public debt, declared that all outsanding government securities would be paid out only at one third of their value. Like the rue Quincampoix, the traditional location of bankers in ancien régime France, such vulgar matters of finance are beneath Monsieur Gillenormand’s attention.

4. Nimois … Picard: i.e., from the region around Nîmes, Picardie, the Franche-Comté, or Poitou.

5. Bayonne … Basque: The city of Bayonne is in the eastern part of the Pyrenees range, on the edge of the Basque country.

6. cordon bleu: here meaning a master chef.

### 3.2.6: In Which We Catch a Glimpse of La Magnon and Her Two Little Boys
1. “Monsieur le duc d’Angoulême”: illegitimate son (1573–1650) of Charles IX (born 1550, reigned 1560–74). Such antiquated gossip was relatively well known among the readers of historical memoirs like Monsieur Gillenormand and Victor Hugo.

2. “knight of Malta”: The crusading order of the Knights Hospitaller of Saint John of Jerusalem were given the island of Malta in 1560. In the eighteenth century, the military-religious order was a convenient honorific to bestow on younger (and bastard) sons, thus limiting the number of eligible heirs to diminishing estates.

3. “Sylvae sint consule dignae”: a pun based on a verse from Virgil’s Bucolics: “Even the woods are worthy of consul.”

4. a soldier of fortune: For a traditionalist like Monsieur Gillenormand, the soldiers of the Grande Armée were little better than pirates or highwaymen.

### 3.2.7: Golden Rule: Only Receive Visitors in the Evening
1. dog-ear style: The oreilles de chien hairstyle, worn long and framing the face on each side, was favoured by the young dandies known as Incroyables in the 1790s.

2. the faubourg Saint-Germain … the Marais: The faubourg Saint-Germain, the left bank neighbourhood around the boulevard Saint-Germain, was the aristocratic neighbourhood of choice from the mid-eighteenth through the nineteenth centuries. The Marais, built around the place des Vosges, had been the most fashionable address in the seventeenth century; by the July Monarchy, it suggested a sort of faded gentility.

### 3.2.8: Two Do Not Make a Pair
1. bigotry: see here; bigotry is meant in the French sense, referring to a rigid, generally conservative set of religious beliefs.

2. the Confraternity of the Virgin: Groups such as this, quasi-religious orders for laypeople, thrived in the renewal of devout Catholicism that occurred among the French under the Restoration and especially the July Monarchy.

3. Agnus Deis and the Ave Marias: “Lamb of God” and “Hail Mary,” prayers of the Catholic Church.

## Book 3: Grandfather and Grandson
### 3.3.1: An Old-World Salon
1. Monsieur de Bonald and even Monsieur Bengy-Puy-Vallée: two paragons of ultra-royalism under the Restoration. The vicomte de Bonald (1754–1840) was an influential writer and legislator; Monsieur Bengy-Puy-Vallée was rather more obscure, and there may be some irony in the pairing of these two names.

2. la baronne de T——: There is no obvious model for the baroness, but ambassadorships, particularly to a capital as important as Berlin, were typically given only to the highest nobility under the ancien régime.

3. “a very mixed bag”: i.e., the Restoration court, which included members of the imperial aristocracy.

4. the Jacobinism of Louis XVIII: Compared to his family and the ultra-royalists, Louis XVIII, who deemed 1814 the nineteenth year of his reign, was considered a moderate for his conciliatory pragmatism. Hugo barely exaggerates the attitude of the Ultras.

5. Monsieur, later Charles X: Monsieur, the comte d’Artois, was far more conservative than his elder brother, and his succession to the throne in 1824 was seen by the Ultras as a chance to turn back the historical clock.

6. “the federates”: the name given volunteers for the regional National Guards in the early years of the Revolution. It was the federates of Marseilles who first sang the “Marseillaise,” which these lyrics parody.

7. Pull … flag!: “Renforcez dans vos culottes / Le bout d’chems’ qui vous pend. / Qu’on n’ dis pas qu’ les patriotes / Ont arboré l’dropeau blanc!”

8. the Dessolles ministry … Deserre: The marquis de Dessolles was president of the Council of Ministers (prime minister) from 1817 to 1819; Élie Decazes, who had become the favourite of Louis XVIII—who called him “mon cher fils”—was minister of the interior; and George Deserre was minister of justice. All three were moderately liberal politicians.

9. To shore up … pot: “Pour raffermir letrone ébranlé sur sa base, / Il faut changer de sol, et de serre et de case.”

10. Damas, Sabran, Gouvion-Saint-Cyr: The marquis de Gouvion-Saint-Cyr (1764–1830) and the baron de Damas (1785–1862) were both aristocrats who served in the imperial armies and then the Restoration government, Damas succeeding Saint-Cyr as minister of war under Louis XVIII. The inclusion of Sabran in this list is not clear.

11. “Ça ira”: a popular and violent revolutionary song that celebrated the hanging of aristocrats from the lampposts of Paris. The denizens of Madame de T——’s salon have replaced the aristocrats with “Buonapartists” in their lyrics.

12. Ah! … lampposts!: “Ah! ça ira! ça ira! ça ira! / Les buonapartist’ à la lanterne!”

13. Fualdès affair: In 1817, Antoine-Bernadin Fualdès, a former public prosecutor (procureur impérial) under the Napoleonic government, was brutally murdered in Rodez. Two men named Bastide and Jausion were arrested, convicted, and executed in Toulouse in 1818. The sensational case was closely followed throughout France.

14. “the brothers and friends”: a mocking allusion to the Revolutionary ideal of fraternité.

15. the comte de Lamothe-Valois … strange amnesties: Antoine-Nicolas Lamothe, or Lamotte, a fraudulent count who married Jeanne de Valois-Saint-Rémy (1756–91), the descendant of a bastard of the Valois dynasty. The comte de Lamothe-Valois and his wife had been the principal orchestrators of the “Necklace Affair,” an ancien régime scandal that had badly damaged the public image of the royal family, hence the “strange amnesties.”

16. Marigny, brother of La Pompadour: Louis XV had made his mistress’s brother, Abel Poisson, the marquis de Marigny.

17. Monsieur le prince de Soubise: The prince de Soubise was a member of the Rohan family, who claimed descent from the ancient kings of Brittany. He was the father-in-law (and cousin) of the prince de Guéménée, whose bankruptcy in 1782 was still another scandal for the court aristocracy.

18. Du Barry, godfather of La Vaubernier: “Godfather” could not be used more ironically. Jean du Barry was the patron and brother-in-law of Madame du Barry, née Jeanne Bécu, Vaubernier being the name of her father, a monk at the Picpus monastery in Paris. Du Barry married the beautiful young prostitute to his elder brother, the comte du Barry, in order to give her entry into high society and thus a better clientele. She eventually became the mistress of Louis XV.

19. Monsieur le maréchal de Richelieu’s: Monsieur le maréchal de Richelieu was one of the celebrated grands seigneurs and libertines of the eighteenth century. The ducs de Richelieu were the (indirect) descendants and heirs of the cardinal de Richelieu.

20. Mercury: Hermes in Greek mythology, the messenger god was also a thief and a prankster.

21. the king of Prussia … marquis de Brandenburg: By tradition, monarchs travelling in foreign lands used assumed names in order to facilitate protocol—Louis XVIIII in exile was known as the comte de Lille. Louis XVIII, the alleged Jacobin, considered himself the scion of the oldest dynasty in Europe and first among equals with other monarchs, and thus alienated the rulers of the countries that had restored him to his throne with his “refined impertinence”—when Czar Alexander I arrived for a meeting, Louis never asked him to sit down. Marquis (margrave) de Brandenburg was the ancient title of the Hohenzollerns before they became electors and then kings of Prussia.

22. Courrier français: a liberal-leaning newspaper (several newspapers of various political stripes have been published with that title).

23. Monsieur de Talleyrand: Monsieur Gillenormand, and Hugo, take their inspiration from Chateaubriand, who, having seen the clubfooted Talleyrand and Fouché arriving for an audience with Louis XVIII after Waterloo, later wrote, “And then Vice entered, supported by Crime, M. de Talleyrand leaning on the arm of M. Fouché.”

24. brigand of the Loire: After Waterloo and Napoléon’s abdication, the soldiers loyal to him retreated beyond the Loire River before officially surrendering.

### 3.3.2: One of the Red Ghosts of the Time
1. Vernon: a small town on the Seine in Normandy, about forty miles from Paris. Colonel Baron Pontmercy’s exile has certain parallels with that of General Count Hugo, although the author’s father lived in Blois, on the banks of the Loire, and the woman he lived with was his mistress, not an old servant.

2. Soulange-Bodin: Étienne Soulange-Bodin (1774–1846) made great advances in botany.

3. Georges Pontmercy: There are many indirect parallels between the careers of Marius’s father and Victor Hugo’s. Both were simple soldiers who rose through the ranks through battlefield promotions. Both fought in Germany and then in Italy, but General Hugo remained in Italy, where he eventually became Joseph Bonaparte’s aide-de-camp before following le roi Joseph to Spain in 1808, remaining there until 1813. In 1814, General Hugo was sent to command the fortified town of Thionville, where he held out against the allies even after Napoléon had surrendered and embarked for Elba. During the Hundred Days, Napoléon sent him back to Thionville, which he again held after the final abdication. It was only in November 1815, some five months after Napoléon had been shipped off to Saint Helena, that General Hugo surrendered.

4. fought at Spires … Mayence: battles of the Revolutionary armies in the early 1790s. Pontmercy’s military career follows Napoléon to Waterloo, making it somewhat more glamorous than General Hugo’s, which was spent mostly in the Napoleonic quagmire in Spain.

5. Houchard’s rear guard … Audernach: General Jean-Nicolas Houchard (1740–1793) was guillotined in November 1793, after attempting a strategic retreat to Audernach that turned into a rout of French armies by the forces of the prince of Hesse.

6. Joubert: Barthélemy Catherine Joubert (1769–99), Napoléon’s successor commanding the Army of Italy, was defeated by the Austrians and their Russian allies before being killed at the battle of Novi in August 1799.

7. Berthier’s … Lodi: Prince Louis-Alexandre Berthier (1753–1815) was Napoléon’s chief of staff and closest confidant. Lodi was a significant victory (May 1796) in establishing General Bonaparte’s reputation as the heroic commander of the Army of Italy.

8. the red, white, and blue: i.e., the tricolour flag that was still the symbol of the Consulate.

9. Wettingen: an early French victory in the 1805 campaign that culminated in the defeat of Austria and Russia at Austerlitz.

10. Wurmser taken prisoner in Mantua … Mack in Ulm: three Austrian generals forced to surrender to French armies: Wurmser at Mantua in 1797; Mélas in Alexandria in June 1800; and Mack at Ulm, in Germany, in 1805, a prelude to Napoléon’s victory at Austerlitz.

11. Eylau: a hard-won victory over the Russians and Prussians (February 1807); it was Eylau and even more so the victory at Friedland the following June that led Czar Alexander to accept negotiations, leading to the meeting of the two emperors at Tilsit in July.

12. captain Louis Hugo: Hugo’s poem “Le Cimetière d’Eylau” tells the story of the captain’s heroic stance.

13. Moscow, then the Beresina: The scorched-earth tactic of the Russians made the taking of Moscow (September 1812) a Pyrrhic victory. Forced to retreat, the already weakened Grande Armée was trapped, on November 26, between a pursuing Russian force and the Beresina River, where the ice proved too weak to support the planned passage of the army. As the engineering corps raced to fashion a bridge, more than 10,000 French troops were killed, either by drowning or by Cossacks.

14. Lützen, Bautzen … Gelenhausen: battles of the 1813 campaign in Germany, all victories except for the battle of Leipzig (October 16–19), also known as the Battle of Nations, which forced Napoléon to retreat to French territory for the last time.

15. Montmirail, Château-Thierry … Laon: battles of the defensive “French Campaign” as Napoléon’s armies fell back in the face of the allied advance toward Paris. As with his résumé of the German campaign, Hugo ends his list of Pyrrhic victories with a defeat, that of the battle of Laon on March 10.

16. Eight days before the capitulation: General Marmont signed an armistice with the Allies at 2 A.M. on March 31, 1814; allied armies entered Paris later that day, while Napoléon retreated to Fontainebleau. On April 3, the imperial legislature pronounced Napoléon’s removal as emperor; on April 4, he abdicated, under the condition that his four-year-old son be recognized as Emperor Napoléon II, under the regency of Empress Marie-Louise; the Allies refused his conditions; on April 6, Napoléon abdicated unconditionally while his senate, under the leadership of Talleyrand, voted a proclamation recognizing Louis XVIII as king of the French. Pontmercy’s refusal to surrender recalls General Hugo’s holdout at Thionville.

17. half pay: One of the great blunders of the first Restoration was, in 1814, to place large numbers of officers on half pay (demi-solde), a quasi-official retirement with inadequate pension. This policy made the army far more receptive to Napoléon’s return from Elba.

18. King Louis XVIII … recognized neither … title as baron: Like Pontmercy’s, the title granted to General Hugo (count of Siguenza and Sifuentes) was never officially registered in Paris and was thus unrecognized by the Restoration.

19. Sir Hudson Lowe: governor of Saint Helena, the final villain of the Napoleonic saga.

20. “The greatest families are forced to do it”: Napoléon aggressively encouraged marriages between the old nobility of the faubourg Saint-Germain and the new nobility of his marshals, generals, and colonels.

21. the legacy from Mademoiselle Gillenormand: French law closely governed questions of inheritance.

22. hiding behind a pillar: When their parents had a falling-out, the very young Victor Hugo would hide behind a pillar at Saint-Sulpice in order to see his future wife, Adèle Foucher, attending mass in the company of her mother.

### 3.3.3: Requiescant—R.I.P.
1. the salon of Madame de T——: this crowded salon is something of a reflection of the atmosphere the adolescent Victor Hugo grew up in. Madame Hugo liked to blame her failed marriage on her royalist principles, and if the company she kept was far less grand than Madame de T——’s guests (Beauffremont, Clermont-Tonnerre, and la Luzerne are some of the great names of the old aristocracy), the Revolution and Empire were vilified by Hugo’s mother and her friends. While most of the baroness’s guests are real people, only those who played some larger role in history or Hugo’s life are discussed here. As the title of the chapter makes clear, Madame de T—— and her guests are living relics of another time.

2. Trestaillon: leader of a violent royalist reaction—the Terreur blanche—in the south of France (see here).

3. The bailiff of Ferrette … on his way to Monsieur de Talleyrand’s: Talleyrand, a rich European celebrity, had a house that was a gathering place for those elements of Parisian high society who were less ideological than Madame de T—— and her guests. For an old libertine like the bailiff of Ferrette, Talleyrand’s house would have been far more agreeable.

4. the comte d’Artois: In his pre-Revolutionary youth, the future Charles X had been the only Bourbon of his generation to uphold the family tradition of libertinage. Time and the death of his favourite mistress led him back to the Church.

5. Aristotle … La Guimard: According to a medieval legend, the Athenian courtesan Campaspe, or Phyllis, the mistress of Alexander the Great, seduced Aristotle and, as proof of his love, demanded that he allow her to ride his back while he crawled on all fours. For medieval moralists, this was a warning of the perfidy of woman, the dangers of desires of the flesh, and the arrogance of human intellect. “La Guimard” refers to one of the famous courtesans of the eighteenth century (see here).

6. the abbé Frayssinous: Denis-Antoine-Luc Frayssinous (1765–1841), an intimate of Charles X.

7. advocate of the saints: In the “trials” that determine if a candidate is fit for sainthood, the advocate of the saints pleads the case of the nominee, while the devil’s advocate offers the counterevidence.

8. Chateaubriand: Le Conservateur was the Ultra newspaper Chateaubriand contributed to when he was dismissed from Louis XVIII’s government in 1816, which in turn inspired the young and still royalist Hugo brothers to found Le Conservateur littéraire in 1818.

9. hating the Encyclopaedia: Diderot’s Encyclopédie of 1751–72.

10. White—legitimist—Paris society: i.e., commited to the Bourbons.

11. Chateaubriand … Père Duchesne: As with Louis XVIII’s “Jacobinism,” the conservative but constitutional monarchist Chateaubriand can be compared to the violently revolutionary Père Duchesne (see here) only by almost fanatical ultra-royalists.

12. Comte Beugnot: Jacques-Claude Beugnot (1761–1835) came from an old family of the robe nobility but served both the Napoleonic and Restoration governments.

13. The “noble” salons of today … to their credit: Hugo is apparently referring to the Paris of 1860–62, when the futility of royalism made those who adhered to it admirable, while “‘noble’ salons” did nothing to oppose the tyranny of Louis-Napoléon.

14. the duchesses de Longueville and de Chevreuse: heroines of the Fronde, the period of aristocratic rebellion against Cardinal Mazarin, who animate the memoirs of the ducs de La Rochefoucauld and Saint-Simon.

15. “besmirched by the usurper”: The “usurper” is, of course, Napoléon, who required his courtiers to address him as “Your Majesty” and “Sire.”

16. Methuselah informed Epimenides: Methuselah lived for 967 years, according to the book of Genesis, while in Greek legend, Epimenides fell asleep in a cave for fifty-seven years.

17. The time … since Koblenz: the German city where royalist émigrés organized an ultimately unsuccessful counterrevolutionary invasion of France.

18. the advent of Monsieur de Villèle: The appointment of Villèle to the post of prime minister was seen as a triumph for the Ultras, even if he eventually proved too pragmatic for the Right.

19. revenants: literally, “those who have returned”; this is also the French word for ghosts.

20. ci-devants: The term used to describe “former” noblemen during the Revolution, ci-devant came to refer to those aristocrats who clung to the traditions of the ancien régime.

21. the nobility of the Crusades: The ideal of the French aristocracy under the ancien régime, when custom dictated that only those who could prove four hundred years of noble ancestry could be presented at court. In the eighteenth century, some notoriously creative geneaologies were used to gain access to court.

22. Fontenoy … Marengo: battles of the ancien régime and the Empire, respectively.

23. Monsieur de Martainville: a royalist playwright and actor (1776–1830) who is best remembered as the founder of the Ultra newspaper Le Drapeau blanc.

24. Fiévée … Agier: Joseph Fiévée was a journalist who tacked his sails to the prevailing wind, switching from Bonapartism to royalism in 1815. Agier was the leader of a large faction of conservatives in the Chamber of Deputies.

25. After the fifth of September … the eighth of July: an apparent reference to a decree of the Convention on September 5, 1793, which authorized the arrest of “suspects” practically on the whim of Revolutionary authorities, making noble status a virtual crime in itself. July 8, 1815, was the day Louis XVIII returned to Paris after Waterloo. In terms of both numbers and official persecutions, it is a gross exaggeration to compare the Terreur blanche to the Terreur rouge of 1793–94.

26. Monsieur de Vaublanc: minister of the interior to Louis XVIII.

27. The Congregation: The Chevaliers de la Foi, or Knights of Faith, a mostly aristocratic group committed first to the Church and second to politics, became an almost mythical force in the popular political imagination under the Restoration. The Congregation plays a large role in Stendhal’s Le Rouge et le noir—far larger, probably, than it ever played in fact.

### 3.3.6: What It Is to Have Met a Churchwarden
1. the Moniteur: the quasi-official newspaper of virtually every French government from 1789 to 1901. Bonaparte was especially conscious of the usefulness of such an outlet.

2. the Mémorial de Sainte-Hélène: Emmanuel de Las Cases served as an officer in the Napoleonic armies before following Napoléon to Saint Helena. Although ordered by the British to leave after a year, Las Cases had sufficient time to interview Napoléon and gather the notes he would use in composing the Mémorial, a hagiographic account of the Napoleonic epic. A huge success from the moment of its publication, the Mémorial was one of the most important factors in shaping Napoléon’s legend in the 1820s.

3. the bulletins of the Grande Armée: The bulletins were official accounts of the actions of Napoléon’s army. A key tool of imperial propaganda, the bulletins were sometimes praised for their writing; Hugo’s “Homeric stanzas” more likely refers to the content than the style. The bulletins were recognized as propaganda at the time; the saying “to lie like the bulletins” became common among soldiers.

4. Mirabeau … Danton: some of the greatest figures of the Revolution. Mirabeau (1749–91) was the famous orator who dominated the Constituent Assembly. Pierre Vergniaud (1753–93) was one of the leading figures of the Girondist faction, moderate republicans who were eclipsed by the more radical Jacobins. Vergniaud was among those executed after the Jacobins triumphed in the spring of 1793. On Saint-Just, see here. Robespierre, the leader of the Jacobins, was overthrown in the coup of 9 Thermidor, July 28, 1794. On Desmoulins, see here. On Danton, see here.

5. the monster who was his sisters’ lover … poisoner of Jaffa: such was the royalist propaganda against Napoléon, that he and his brothers committed incest with their sisters; “ham actor” refers to the rumours that Napoléon had been taught how to perform in public by the actor Talma (see here). The legend of the “poisoner of Jaffa” refers to the Egyptian campaign of 1798–99. Napoléon supposedly poisoned the well at a camp in Jaffa (Haifa) in order to eliminate sick soldiers who were slowing his retreat after encountering an overwhelming Turkish force.

6. Charlemagne … the Committee of Public Safety: some of the most powerful rulers of France. Charlemagne (ca. 750–814), the first Holy Roman emperor, is claimed by the French as a king. Louis XI (born 1423, reigned 1461–83), the Spider King, patiently and ruthlessly consolidated royal power in the wake of the Hundred Years’ War. Hugo helped promote the legend of Louis XI in Notre-Dame de Paris. Henri IV was the first Bourbon king and the grandfather of Louis XIV (born 1638, reigned 1643–1715). Cardinal de Richelieu (1585–1642), the loyal and ruthless prime minister of Louis XIII, worked to strengthen the monarchy. The Committee of Public Safety was the executive component of the Convention, the means through which Robespierre ruled the country.

7. Baron Marius Pontmercy: Like Marius, it was only after his father’s death in 1829 that Hugo began to use the title of “Baron Hugo,” to which he was entitled according to the strict rules of the imperial nobility, his elder brothers being the comte (Abel) and vicomte (Edmond) Hugo.

8. Géronte’s gaiety … the melancholy Werther: The name Géronte was traditionally used for the character of the patriarch in French theatre, including by Molière; Werther was the classic Romantic hero of Goethe’s The Sorrows of Young Werther, a brooding youth in love with an unattainable woman.

### 3.3.7: A Bit of Skirt
1. a good-looking officer: With his moustache, his “girl’s waist,” and his decorative sabre, Lieutenant Théodule is a classic dandy of the era.

2. on top: The cheapest seats on a public coach were those on the top deck, the roof of the carriage itself, which had no protection from the elements.

3. Théodule: Théodule, which can suggest “one who praises God,” is a name well suited to please Mademoiselle Gillenormand, even if the young officer would prefer the more fashionable “Alfred.”

4. Argus snored all night: Argus was the hundred-eyed, all-seeing demigod of Greek mythology.

### 3.3.8: Marble Versus Granite
1. rogues, cutthroats, red caps, thieves: the royalists’ image of the revolutionaries; on red caps, see here.

2. Louis XVIII had been dead four years: Louis XVIII died in 1824.

3. the duc de Berry: the royalist martyr assassinated in 1820; see here.

4. sixty pistoles: a coin worth ten livres, or francs. The word was rarely used in the nineteenth century.

## Book 4: Friends of the ABC
### 3.4.1: A Group That Nearly Became History
1. the German Tugendbund … The Cougourde: The Tugendbund (League of Virtue) was formed in 1808 as a response to the French domination of Germany. Its members sought to promote German nationalism and to fight Napoléon. The Italian Carbonari also formed as a resistance movement in response to the rule of Joachim Murat around 1810. Carbonari groups formed in different parts of Italy, demanding greater liberalism and—in the north—combating Austrian influence. In Savoy and Naples, Carbonari succeeded in forcing the monarchs to grant constitutions. Ironically, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte was a member of the Carbonari before becoming heir to his uncle’s throne and Hugo’s nemesis. The Cougourde, a secret organization of republicans, had only begun to form under the July Monarchy; like their fictional contemporaries in the Friends of the ABC, they were “at the embryo stage.”

2. Castratus ad castrata … hanc Petram: “From castrato to the camp.” The eunuch Narses was made a general by the Byzantine emperor Justinian. Barbari et Barbarini: “What the barbarians didn’t take, the Barbarini will”; in the seventeenth century, the aristocratic Roman Barbarini family appropriated a number of antiquities for their palace. Feuros y fuegos: “Rights and hearths!” was the motto of Spanish liberals in the revolt of 1823. Tu es Petrus … hanc Petrum: Jesus’ words to Peter: “You are Peter and on this rock I shall build my Church” (see here).

3. Les Halles … Café Musain: The great Halles of Paris were still the site of the central market. Corinthe was one of the independent city-states of ancient Greece. The place Saint-Michel was not the modern square on the left bank of the Seine but on the site of today’s place Edmond Rostand, just outside the Luxembourg gardens.

4. the main ones: The nine Friends of the ABC are generally seen as reflections of different aspects of Victor Hugo.

5. Antinous: The lover of the Roman emperor Hadrian, Antinous is one of the classic images of male beauty from antiquity.

6. Gracchus … Saint-Just: The Gracchi were two brothers who served as tribunes in Rome; both sought to reform land ownership in favour of the poor, and both were persecuted by the patrician class. The youthful Saint-Just (see here) was a leader of the Revolution who was executed before his thirtieth birthday.

7. Evadné’s bare breast … Harmodius: Hugo seems to have confused his allusions here. Evadné was a beautiful young woman loved by Apollo who rejected the god in favour of the warrior Capane; when Capane was killed in battle, Evadné threw herself on his funeral pyre. Harmodius and Aristogeiton hid their daggers in flowers during a procession in order to take revenge on Hip-parch, who had seduced the sister of Harmodius.

8. the gallant cherubs of Beaumarchais … Ezekiel: Cherubino is a charming, Puck-like character, a boy traditionally played by a young woman, in Beaumarchais’ Marriage of Figaro. The “awesome cherubim” in the Old Testament Book of Ezekiel are fierce and unearthly creatures who guard the heavens.

18. 1772: the first of three partitions of Poland in the eighteenth century by Russia, Prussia, and Austria (“that crime of three”). Upon the third partition, in 1795, Poland ceased to exist.

Hugo called for a free Poland in one of his first speeches before the Chamber of Peers, in 1846.

19. ne varietur: “without exception.”

20. One of the false ideas … that particle: The “nobiliary particle” was not as insignificant as Hugo claims, but it was far more important after the Revolution than before and probably more important to the bourgeoisie than to the aristocracy.

31. Pollux … Pechméja: a reference to some legendary male friendships. Pollux with Castor, Patroclus with Achilles, Nisus with Euryale (in The Iliad), Eudamidas was the friend of Charixane in the work of the Roman poet Lucian. The modern example is Jean de Pechméja (1741–85), who was so devoted to his friend Dr. Dubrueil that he cared for the doctor through a fatal and contagious illness and died two weeks after the doctor did.

32. Orestes and Pylades: Orestes, son of Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, was raised with Pylades, the son of a foreign king.

Within three days (Les Trois glorieuses) it became clear that the government could not survive. Charles abdicated, and his son the duc d’Angoulême renounced his right to succession. An interim government offered the throne of a constitutional monarchy to Louis-Philippe d’Orléans.

Carnot was among the former colleagues of the Convention, Directory, and Empire that Fouché ordered into exile, before the Ultras procured his exile in turn.

5. “Hernani”: With tongue in cheek, Hugo mocks the reaction to his own play of 1830, which was enormously controversial for its complete break with the traditions of French theatre (hence, “not even written in French!”). The antithesis was one of Hugo’s favourite literary devices.

6. “Benjamin Constant”: see here.

8. “Sieyès”: On the “patriot priest” Joseph Sieyès (1748–1836), see here. Sieyès was one of the most influential voices of the Revolution, from 1788 until 1799.

The academician François de Neufchâteau (1750–1828; see here) had hired the young prodigy Victor Hugo to write an article on Gil Blas. Hugo was unaware that he was being hired as a ghostwriter and was shocked and indignant to see his work published under the name of Neufchâteau, who had been dead more than thirty years when Hugo took this mild literary revenge.

5. a Louis XV uniform: i.e., an old-fashioned uniform. Louis XV died in 1774, so it would have been quite possible to see a veteran of his reign in the 1830s.

Caesar for Prusias … king of Yvetot: Prusias was a king in Italy in the second century B.C.E. who offered to violate the rules of hospitality by killing his guest Hannibal in order to ingratiate himself to the Romans.

5. The Hôtel de Ville … replaced the cathedral of Rheims: The ceremonies that installed Louis-Philippe on the throne took place at the town hall of Paris rather than at Rheims Cathedral, where French kings had been crowned for almost a thousand years, an antiquated tradition that Charles X had attempted to revive in 1825.

### 4.1.3: Louis-Philippe
1. Son of a father: Louis-Philippe’s father, the duc d’Orléans (1747–93), first prince of the blood royal, ostentatiously joined the Revolution, probably hoping to replace his cousin, Louis XVI, on the throne. He renamed himself Philippe-Égalité, renounced his royal privileges, and was elected to the Convention, where he voted for the execution of Louis. He himself was guillotined only a few months later.

2. first prince of the blood: In the elaborate system of etiquette developed by the Bourbons, the first prince of the blood held the third rank at court, after the “fils de France” and “petits fils de France,” the sons and grandsons of the king.

3. daring against Austria at Ancona … paying off Pritchard: events of Louis-Philippe’s reign that loomed large in Hugo’s lifetime but are largely forgotten now. Austrian influence in Italy and English meddling in Spanish politics were seen as a threat to French interests, just as the European powers resisted putting an Orléans prince on the throne of the new nation of Belgium.

4. a general at Valmy … Jemappes: As the sons of the Revolutionary duke, Louis-Philippe and his younger brothers had enlisted in the Revolutionary armies. The battles of Jemappes (November 1792) and Valmy (September 1792) were victories for the republican army over the Austro-German forces. Louis-Philippe served as a competent junior officer, neither a private nor a general, in both battles.

5. Poland and Hungary: The causes of Polish resistance to Russia and Hungarian resistance to Austria were popular among European liberals.

6. “les polonois” and said “les hongraïs”: Standard French spelling (and pronunciation) changed during the years of Revolution and Empire; in 1830, the correct spelling was les Polonais and les Hongrois.

7. Henri III … his dagger: At the time of the Wars of Religion, Henri III was under constant threat of assassination.

8. the rue Transnonain: In April 1834, a troop of soldiers under General Bugeaud (see here) was fired on in the rue Transnonain, near Les Halles. The soldiers stormed the house and killed several occupants. Accounts differ as to whether those killed were connected to the shooting, and the actual shooters are believed to have escaped via the roof. A government inquiry cleared the soldiers, but in the popular mind, the “massacre of the rue Transnonain” was another black mark against the government.

9. Belgium rejected: When the Belgians gained independence from the Dutch in 1830, a faction in Brussels offered the Belgian throne to Louis-Philippe’s younger son. The Orléans were reluctantly persuaded to refuse in deference to English and German concerns. A marriage was arranged between one of Louis-Philippe’s daughters and the German prince who became King Léopold I.

10. Algeria conquered too brutally: The conquest of Algeria was France’s opening move in the European colonization of Africa. It had begun under Charles X and was continued by the July Monarchy.

11. Abd-el-Kader: Abd-el-Kader (1808–85) was an Algerian emir and Muslim theologian who became the leader of the anti-French resistance. Throughout the 1830s he negotiated a series of truces with the French, none of which was kept.

12. profound tenderness … for his family: Hugo had the chance to witness the Orléans as a family; as the most famous writer in France in the late 1830s and early 1840s, he was a frequent guest of the royal family. He was especially friendly with the duc d’Orléans (1810–42), heir to the throne, and his wife.

13. Marie d’Orléans: Louis-Philippe’s daughter (1813–39), a sculptress. Charles, Duc d’Orléans (1394–1465), was an accomplished poet.

14. Metternich: Klemens von Metternich (1773–1859), the powerful Austrian politician who was, with Wellington, one of the living symbols of conservatism in the early nineteenth century.

15. He had been banned, errant, poor: As heir to his father’s fortune, Louis-Philippe was the owner of the richest princely domains in France, which of course had been confiscated by the Revolution. After fleeing the Revolution (see below), he took refuge at Reichenau in Switzerland and worked as a tutor and schoolteacher.

16. Adélaïde: Louis-Philippe’s formidable and fiercely loyal younger sister, known as Mademoiselle Adélaïde (1777–1847), was her brother’s closest adviser; she frequently encouraged his ambition and stiffened his resolve.

17. the last iron cage: Hugo had used the iron cages of Louis XI in Notre-Dame de Paris.

18. Dumouriez’s: Charles-François Dumouriez (1739–1823), the Revolutionary general, had been Louis-Philippe’s commander in the Revolutionary armies. When Dumouriez defected to the Austrians in April 1793, Louis-Philippe followed his example and took refuge in Switzerland.

19. “Young man!”: i.e., the terrible republican had addressed the erstwhile prince and future king in familiar and friendly terms.

20. Monsieur de Chartres: The eldest son of the duc d’Orléans had been called the duc de Chartres under the ancien régime.

21. Capet: The royal family was called Capet during the Revolution, after Hugh Capet, the tenth-century ancestor of the Bourbons.

22. a witness beyond all possible doubt: Hugo himself.

23. The laws of September: Following Fieschi’s attempted assassination (see below), the government passed laws intending to strengthen the prosecution of suspected antigovernment plots; Hugo argues that the laws were sufficiently open to public scrutiny.

24. Louis Blanc: A leading early socialist, Blanc (1811–82) served, like Hugo, in the governments of the Second and Third Republics and spent the intervening years of the Second Empire in exile. Although the two shared similar concerns about the welfare of the poor, Blanc was well to Hugo’s left.

25. La Grève … barrière Saint-Jacques: In 1830, the site of public executions was moved from the place de Grève, in the centre of Paris, to the barrière Saint-Jacques, on the southern edge of the city.

26. Casimir Périer: a banker and politician (1777–1832), Louis-Philippe’s prime minister (1831–32); a liberal under the Restoration and supporter of the July Revolution. Périer’s conservatism in office was an early indicator that the July Monarchy would not be as liberal as many had hoped. One of his most significant acts was the severe repression of a revolt of unemployed silk workers in Lyon in 1831.

27. Beccaria: see here. The Italian philosopher was an advocate of penal reform and an opponent of the death penalty.

28. the Fieschi plot: The Corsican Giuseppe Fieschi (1790–1836) built a machine infernale—twenty-four rifles rigged to fire simultaneously—along a planned parade route, hoping to assassinate the king and the royal family in July 1835. The king and his family were unhurt, but twenty bystanders were killed. At his trial Fieschi and his coconspirators were proved to have been acting out of “exalted” republican beliefs, but no link to any larger movement or group could be proved. All three were guillotined.

29. Louis IX: Louis IX was revered in his time as a protector of the common people; he was canonized for leading a crusade.

30. two tombs in exile: This chapter, which looks back on the July Monarchy, is clearly an addition of Hugo’s 1860 revisions; this passage refers to Hugo’s own self-exile under the Second Empire of Napoléon III. Louis-Philippe died in England in 1850.

### 4.1.4: Cracks Beneath the Foundation
1. a Vendéen: a royalist insurgent during the Revolution.

2. To the rights of man: a reference to the Declaration of the Rights of Man, proclaimed by the National Assembly in 1789.

3. as Venice died: General Bonaparte and the republican armies put an end to the polite political fiction of the Venetian Republic in 1797.

4. Lafayette had to be used to defend Polignac: i.e., without Lafayette’s intervention, Polignac would have been assassinated, if not executed.

5. the year 1832 had begun: A repetition in miniature of the chapter “In the Year 1817.” Of greatest importance for Les Misérables is the economic distress of the working classes of Paris and Lyon and the increasing conservatism of the French government, disappointing many liberals and humiliating Lafayette, who had lent his prestige to the July Revolution.

6. Brussels chasing Nassau out: i.e., the Belgians had revolted against the Dutch rule established by the Congress of Vienna in 1815.

7. Poland: An attempted revolt against Russian rule in Poland had been brutally repressed by Czar Nicholas I, who annexed the country outright in 1831.

8. the cross torn down from Notre-Dame: A republican manifestation turned violently anticlerical in 1831; the cathedral was damaged, and the palace of the archbishop was destroyed (see here).

9. the duchesse de Berry in the Vendée: The widow of Charles X’s murdered son and mother of the child known to royalists as Henri V, the duchess attempted to provoke a royalist insurrection in the Vendée. She was quickly captured and imprisoned and lost her status as a royalist icon when she was discovered to be pregnant.

### 4.1.5: Deeds from Which History Emerges and Which History Ignores
1. Bonaparte’s proclamation to the Army of Italy: i.e., in the spring of 1796, the newly appointed commander of the Army of Italy assured his troops that they would share in the spoils of victory.

2. Quénisset: In 1841, Quénisset attempted to assassinate the duc d’Aumale, son of Louis-Philippe.

3. “Babouvist! … smell Gisquet: On the revolutionary Babeuf, whose followers were called “Babouvists,” see here. Joseph-Henri Gisquet (1792–1866) was the prefect of the Paris police from 1831 to 1836.

4. jacquerie: a reference to the fourteenth-century peasant revolts of central France.

5. Saint-Eustache: the parish church of the district around Les Halles.

6. the Court of Peers: a special inquest tribunal made up of members of the Chamber of Peers.

7. Unité … Populaire: Several of the names of the sections have historical resonance. For Barra, see here. Tadeusz Kościuszko (1746–1817) was a leader of the anti-Russian resistance in Poland. On Caius Gracchus, see here. The fall of the Girondins was the ultimate triumph of the Jacobins over the moderates. On Hoche and Marceau, see here.

8. the insurrection of April 1834: A revolt of unemployed silk workers in Lyon began on April 9; over the course of a week, more than six hundred insurgents and soldiers were killed. On the thirteenth, Parisian workers and those sympathetic to them rioted in Paris. The massacre of the rue Transnonain took place in the wake of this unrest.

9. Pluviôse, Year XL: The Revolutionary calendar dated from the fall of the Bourbon monarchy in 1792, so 1832 is the Year XL.

10. The Pikes … Ça ira: Pikes were the weapon of choice during the insurrections of 1789–92. On the phrygian cap, see here. January 21 was the day of Louis XVI’s execution in 1793. “Ça ira” was a revolutionary song (see here).

11. Belfort, Lunéville, and Épinal movements: Republican soldiers in these three important forts in western France rebelled in sympathy with the Lyonnais silk workers in April 1834.

12. “Tree of Liberty”: a custom of the Revolution.

13. Ennius: Latin poet of the second century B.C.E.

14. “sybilline wine”: The source of sybilline wine is unclear, but it suggests an allusion to the Greek oracles known as “sybils,” thus wine that gives the gift of prophecy.

15. Ingens: power.

### 4.1.6: Enjolras and His Lieutenants
1. “polytechnic students”: Students of the École Polytechnique were traditionally in the front rank of the protests and insurrections of nineteenth-century Paris.

2. “Dupuytren’s”: see here.

3. “the Contrat Social … my constitution for the Year II”: Grantaire offers his republican bona fides by loosely citing some of the founding documents of the Revolution, such as Rousseau’s Du Contrat social (1768) and the revolutionary constitution (there was no constitution voted in 1794/Year II, but there was in 1793/Year I and 1795/Year III; Grantaire quotes the former). Louis-Marie Prud’homme was a relatively obscure journalist during the Revolution who became a supporter of the Bourbons during the Restoration. A curious name to cite alongside that of Rousseau.

4. “assignat”: see here.

5. “Hébertist”: the most radical faction of the Revolution of 1789.

## Book 2: Éponine
### 4.2.1: The Lark’s Field
1. salle des pas perdus: i.e., a waiting room.

2. men like Escousse and Lebras: Barely twenty, Escousse and Lebras made and carried out a suicide pact in 1832 when a play they had cowritten failed.

3. Ruisdael: Jacob van Ruisdael (1629–82), a Dutch landscape painter.

### 4.2.2: Embryonic Development of Crimes in Prison Incubators
1. Némorin … Schinderhannes: Némorin was the hero-lover of a Romantic novel, Estelle and Némorin; on the criminal Schinderhannes; see here; that is, Montparnasse would rather seduce Éponine than work with Thénardier and their accomplices.

2. the Salon: a juried exposition of art sponsored by the government.

### 4.2.4: Marius’s Apparition
1. Gans and Savigny: two German law professors who disputed the theories of Hegel as applied to law. Karl Marx studied with both men.

2. Ophelia: In Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Ophelia is driven mad by Hamlet’s own growing madness.

## Book 3: The House in the Rue Plumet
### 4.3.1: The House with a Secret Entrance
1. the parliament of Paris: the largest and most powerful of the law courts of the ancien régime.

2. “a little house”: In the grand tradition of libertinage, great aristocrats and their wealthy imitators built or bought small houses expressly for the purpose of assignations.

3. Mansart … Watteau: François Mansart (1598–1666), an influential architect; Watteau (see here) was the great late-baroque painter of the fête galante; the rocaille, or rococo, interior and the stolid exterior, which suggests the wig of the staid magistrate, make the house a metaphor for the secret love affairs it was built for.

4. the hospital: i.e., from extreme poverty, from dying in a charity hospital.

5. rue de l’Ouest … rue de l’Homme-Armé: The rue de l’Ouest, today absorbed into the rue d’Assas, was near the Luxembourg gardens; the rue de l’Homme-Armé was on the western edge of the Marais.

### 4.3.2: Jean Valjean as a National Guard
1. man of means, was in the National Guard: Those with sufficient assets to qualify as voters were required to serve periodically in the National Guard.

2. local mairie: Each arrondissement had a mayor and mairie.

3. the comte de Lobau: the Napoleonic general and count Georges Mouton (1770–1838), loyal to Napoléon, briefly exiled by the Bourbons, named marshal and peer of France by Louis-Philippe.

### 4.3.3: Foliis ac Frondibus
1. Foliis ac Frondibus: leaves and branches.

2. Floréal: month of the revolutionary calendar, roughly April 20–May 19, named after the bloom of spring flowers.

### 4.3.4: Gate Change
1. Paphos: In Greek mythology, Paphos, on the island of Crete, was the place where Aphrodite stepped out of the sea.

2. Lamoignon … Le Nôtre: i.e., the parlementaire takes himself for a second Chrétien-François Lamoignon (1613–1700), president of the Paris parlement under Louis XIV, and his gardener for André Le Nôtre, the landscape architect of the Versailles gardens.

3. camera obscura: Latin for “dark chamber,” an optic device, invented in the eighteenth century, that used the play of light through a lens to project an image inside a box.

### 4.3.5: The Rose Realizes She Is an Engine of War
1. a hat by Gérard … Herbaut: two fashionable milliners in Restoration Paris.

### 4.3.8: The Chain Gang
1. “La Vestale” … Désaugiers’s: The songwriter Marc-Antoine Désaugiers (1772–1827) was also a theatre owner, enormously successful with vaudeville and other popular theatre. “La Vestale” dates from 1807.

2. the Gemoniae: the Gemonian Stairs, or Stairs of Mourning, which led from the Forum down to the Tiber in ancient Rome. A site of public execution, used with the intent of publicly shaming the criminals after their death. The corpses of the executed were left there to rot.

## Book 5: Whose End is Nothing Like Its Beginning
### 4.5.2: Cosette’s Fears
1. Euryanthe: Karl Maria von Weber’s 1823 opera.

### 4.5.3: Embellished by Toussaint’s Comments
1. “like it was the Bastille”: The Bastille was a massive military fortress and arsenal.

### 4.5.6: The Old Are Made for Going Out at the Right Moment
1. One kiss, and that was everything: The overgrown garden of the rue Plumet is generally taken as a remembrance of a similar garden attached to the house where Victor Hugo lived as a child, where he would play with his future wife, Adèle Foucher.

## Book 6: Petit-Gavroche
### 4.6.1: Nasty Trick of the Wind
1. the maréchale de la Mothe-Houdancourt: an apparent reference to Saint-Simon’s Mémoires; an influential aristocrat who married each of her three daughters to dukes.

### 4.6.2: In Which Petit-Gavroche Puts Napoléon the Great to Good Use
1. the first great epidemic of the century: An epidemic of cholera swept through Paris in 1832.

2. worthy of meeting Faust on the Brocken: In Goethe’s Faust, the hero meets the devil on top of the Brocken, the highest peak in northern Germany, which had a long history of being associated with witches and Walpurgis Night.

3. Saint Martin … cloak: see here.

4. the Iowas and the Botocudos: references to indigenous peoples of Brazil.

5. the Conciergerie: the massive medieval fortress on the Île de la Cîté, a former royal palace turned prison. It was where prisoners of the Revolution, most famously Marie Antoinette, awaited the tumbrils that would take them to the guillotine.

6. red-tails of the grand siècle: The painter and engraver Jacques Callot (1592–1635) was actually a generation older than Molière (1622–73); he often chose scenes from lower-class life as the subject of his drawings. Molière sometimes worked into his comedies the argot of the working class from the Les Halles neighbourhood he had grown up in, most notably in Le bourgeois gentilhomme.

7. a member of the Institut, commander in chief of the Army of Egypt: i.e., Napoléon Bonaparte. The elephant, which stood in the place de la Bastille from 1814 until 1846, was a plaster model of an intended monument to the Egyptian campaign.

8. this stovepipe: The July Column was inaugurated in 1840.

9. a child caught sleeping: Hugo gives no record of this incident, but several such occasions noted in Les Misérables were based on fact.

10. the great tun of Heidelberg: see here.

11. Jonas … the biblical whale: the Old Testament book of Jonah, in which God sends a whale to punish Jonah’s disobedience.

12. The claque … the boulevards: An old tradition in the French theatre, claques were groups who went to applaud or to jeer a play, depending on their taste, their relationship to the author, or—most commonly—who was paying them. Paid claques were used especially by and against Hugo at the tempestuous premiere of Hernani in 1830. Gavroche is bragging a bit by claiming to have nothing to do with the popular theatres of the boulevards (see here).

13. Paul de Kock: An immensely prolific popular novelist, Paul de Kock (1793–1871) wrote many novels and almost two hundred plays for vaudeville and the popular theatre. His work treated the lower classes of Paris with a combination of humour and sentimentality.

14. the Théâtre Ambigu: One of the boulevard theatres Gavroche claimed to disdain, the Théâtre Ambigu, in the boulevard du Temple, specialized in vaudeville, comedy, and melodrama.

15. what the good storyteller Perrault calls “fresh meat”: from Petit Poucet (Tom Thumb in English) by Charles Perrault (1628–1703), the cry with which the ogre hunts Tom and his brothers.

### 4.6.3: The Ups and Downs of Escape
1. Milton glimpsed behind Berquin: John Milton (1697–74) painted a vision of hell in Paradise Lost; Arnaud Berquin (1747–91) wrote sentimental and moralistic books for children.

3. “Qu’il mourut”: from Corneille’s play Horace. Corneille was one of Hugo’s favourite playwrights.

4. the nearby clock of Saint Paul: the church of Saint-Paul on the rue Saint-Antoine, near the place des Vosges.

5. the argot of the Temple: i.e., of the neighbourhood around the Temple; see here.

6. Poulailler and Cartouche: two famous criminals. On Cartouche, see here. Poulailler was an eighteenth-century bandit who preyed on prosperous farms and became something of a legend in popular imagination.

7. the language of Racine … André Chénier: Hugo vastly preferred the poetry of Chénier (see here) to the classical verse of Racine.

8. survivors from the Medusa: see here.

## Book 7: Slang
### 4.7.1: Origins
1. thirty-four years ago: a reference to Hugo’s 1830 novel Le Dernier Jour d’un condamné (The Last Day of a Condemned Man), an eloquent statement against the death penalty as well as an intriguingly written first-person monologue of a man facing imminent execution.

2. Balzac and Eugène Sue: Balzac’s 1847 Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes (The Splendour and Misery of Courtesans) and Les Misérables both drew inspiration from Eugène Sue’s Les Mystères de Paris (The Mysteries of Paris), an immensely popular and successful novel when published as a serial in 1842–43 that is rarely read today.

3. Montpellier available, Marseilles: i.e., goods or produce from those cities.

4. the phrenologist: Phrenologists claimed to be able to discern a person’s character according to the shape and contours of the skull. Belief in phrenology was fairly widespread in the nineteenth century.

5. the Hôtel de Rambouillet meets the Cour des Miracles: The salons of the Hôtel de Rambouillet, the Parisian town house of the marquise de Rambouillet, formed the centre of an elite literary culture in the seventeenth century that is often seen as part of the movement of préciosité, especially the sentimental and affected language invented by the précieuses to speak of love. The Cour des Miracles played an important role in Hugo’s Notre-Dame de Paris. In that novel, set in late medieval Paris, the Cours des Miracles were gathering places for thieves, beggars and the homeless. They took their name from the fact that many beggars who claimed some disability were “miraculously” cured when returning there.

6. Monsieur de Montmorency a bourgeois: The Montmorencys were one of the oldest families of the French nobility. The meaning of bourgeois was changing.

7. Jean Bart, Duquesne, Suffren, and Duperré: historic French admirals. The privateer Jean Bart (1650–1702) was named a naval officer by Louis XIV; Admiral Abraham Duquesne (1610–88); Bailli de Suffren (1729–88) was admiral of the French Navy during the American Revolution; Guy Victor Duperré (1775–1845) served under the Restoration and July Monarchy.

8. Plautus: a Roman comic playwright whose work Hugo knew well; see here.

9. Molière … Levantine: In Le bourgeois gentilhomme, Molière used the Levantine patois—a dialect used by Mediterranean sailors from different countries to communicate with one another—in a famous scene.

### 4.7.2: Roots
1. the red-hot brand of the executioner: Those condemned to hard labour, as at Toulon, were branded, with either the letters TF, for Travaux forcés, for limited terms, or TFP, Travaux forcés perpetuels, for life sentences.

2. Mandrin: The bandit Louis Mandrin (1725–55) gained a Robin Hood–esque reputation because he limited his thefts to the rich, especially the hated tax collectors known as fermiers généraux. He was also a smuggler, selling heavily taxed goods, especially tobacco, far cheaper than legitimate merchants could. He was captured and, because the fermiers généraux hated him so much, broken on the wheel.

3. Villon: see here.

4. La Fontaine’s: Jean de La Fontaine (1621–95), author of the Fables.

5. the poor poacher Survincent: Hugo visited several prisons in Paris, including the Châtelet (see here), and is almost certainly quoting a prisoner he met there.

6. “Langleviel La Beaumelle”: Voltaire often used his wit and his pen to take revenge on those who had insulted him. Many of these targets are remembered only because they attracted the great man’s contempt.

### 4.7.3: Slang That Cries and Slang That Laughs
1. Turgot: Anne-Robert Turgot (1727–81), the most prominent of the physiocrats, who unsuccessfully attempted to institute significant reforms as Louis XVI’s minister of finance.

2. weirdly subversive writings … the dregs: It is unclear to whose writings Hugo is referring, but the prince de Conti (Louis-François de Bourbon-Conti, 1727–1776), prince of the blood royal, had a reputation for sponsoring writers who tested the limits of royal censors, including Rousseau and Beaumarchais.

3. Restif de la Bretonne: Nicolas-Edme Restif de la Bretonne (1734–1806) came to Paris from the provinces and studied the lower classes and darker corners of Parisian society.

4. The Robbers: play by Johann von Schiller (1759–1805), a romantic playwright and poet whom Hugo admired.

5. a fourteenth of July, a tenth of August: days of popular insurrection during the Revolution: July 14, 1789, was the day the Bastille was stormed by what is usually called a mob; on August 10, 1792, civilians, National Guard, and soldiers invaded the Tuileries Palace, and the king and the royal family were forced to ask for the protection of the National Assembly, making it the last day of the monarchy.

6. The wagons that carried … in 1848: i.e., during the revolution of 1848.

### 4.7.4: The Two Duties: To Watch and to Hope
1. imams to converse with Bonaparte inside the great pyramid: a singularly romantic image of Bonaparte’s 1798–99 Egyptian campaign.

## Book 8: Enchantment and Desolation
### 4.7.1: Broad Daylight
1. the Jungfrau: one of the highest peaks in the Alps. Hugo plays on multiple images of purity: two white birds meeting on a snow-covered peak, the name of which translates as “virgin.”

### 4.8.4: A Cab Rolls in English and Yelps Like a Mutt in Slang
1. It’s not … Daddy’s neck: “Nous n’sommes pas le jour de l’an, / À bécoter papa, maman.”

2. the Île des Cygnes: a small artificial island in the Seine.

3. My arms … won’t come again: “Mon bras si dodu, / Ma jambe bien faite, / Et le temps perdu.”

### 4.8.6: Marius Falls to Earth and Gives Cosette His Address
1. the Faublases and the Prudhommes: a reference to two fictional characters representing a certain fatuous pseudointellectualism. Faublas refers to the chevalier de Faublas (1760–97), the libertine hero of the comic novels by Jean-Baptiste Louvetin in the 1780s and ’90s. Prudhomme refers to Monnier’s caricatural bourgeois (see here).

2. Busiris: a tyrannical king in Greek mythology, slain by Hercules.

### 4.8.7: Old Heart and Young Heart Face-to-Face
1. Monsieur Humblot-Conté, peer of France: an obscure deputy and supporter of the July Revolution (1776–1845) who was named to the Chamber of Peers by Louis-Philippe and immortalized by Monsieur Gillenormand’s royalist indignation.

2. “prefer sabreurs to sabre-draggers”: i.e., he prefers a real soldier to a uniformed dandy like Théodule.

3. Garat: probably Dominique-Joseph Garat (1749–1833), a journalist and politician.

4. “Molière overlooked this one”: i.e., the absurdity of a young man asking pity from an old man, as in a scene in a farce.

5. “run up debts without even telling me to pay them”: For Monsieur Gillenormand, debts should be a fact of life for any healthy young man.

6. “permission to marry”: The question is not a mere formality. The age of majority for men was twenty-five; Marius would have needed the permission of his grandfather (and legal guardian) to enter into any legal contract.

7. “help storm the Louvre”: i.e., did Marius help bring down the Bourbons in July 1830.

8. “to replace the monument of Monsieur le duc de Berry”: It was in fact in 1844 that a memorial on the site of the duke’s assassination was replaced by a fountain.

9. “twelve hundred livres”: i.e., the six hundred pistoles that Marius has always returned to his aunt.

10. “A real Pamela”: the heroine of Samuel Richardson’s immensely popular novel; see here.

## Book 9: Where are They Going?
### 4.9.1: Jean Valjean
1. Pépin or Morey: another anachronism. Pépin and Morey were the accomplices of Fieschi in the plot against Louis-Philippe in 1835.

### 4.9.2: Marius
1. What devastates Othello … Candide: Shakespeare’s Othello is driven to a murderous rage by the slightest evidence of infidelity on the part of Desde-mona; Voltaire’s simple Candide is incapable of anger against Cunégonde.

2. General Lamarque’s funeral: Jean-Maximilien Lamarque (1770–1832) was a volunteer soldier in the Revolutionary Army and rose to the rank of general under Napoléon. Exiled after Waterloo for having rallied to Napoléon, he returned to France in 1818 and was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1828. A liberal democrat and ally of Lafayette, he was one of the 221 who resisted the July Ordinances (see here). Under the July Monarchy, he remained a member of the opposition, and was particularly noted for his rhetorical support of the Poles, the Greeks, and other oppressed peoples. He died a victim of the cholera epidemic of 1832. His funeral was in fact the trigger for the journée described here as the “epic of the rue Saint-Denis.” Hugo’s biographer Graham Robb points out that in 1832, Victor Hugo barely noticed the insurrection. Although vaguely sympathetic to republicanism and the sufferings of the poor, Hugo—the man Robb describes as being, in 1832, “a tax-paying, property-owning father of four with timorous leanings to the left”—dismissed the journée as “follies drowned in blood.”

### 4.9.3: Monsieur Mabeuf
1. “Round by the Arsenal”: The Arsenal stands on the right bank, just east of the Marais.

## Book 10: June 5, 1832
### 4.10.1: The Issue on the Surface
1. Philinte versus Alceste: In Molière’s Misanthrope, Alceste is the protagonist of unyielding principle who refuses to compromise with the hypocrisies of the society he lives in; his best friend, Philinte, urges him to compromise in order to fit in more comfortably with those around him.

2. the happy medium: le juste milieu, which supporters of the July Monarchy saw as a wise stance based on Aristotle’s “golden mean.” Its detractors on the right and left saw it as Hugo did, as lukewarm political water.

3. Jean Chouan … Jeanne: Jean Chouan was the nom de guerre of Jean Cottereau, a leader of the Chouan movement (the “war of the bushes” Hugo refers to; see here). A worker (ouvrier) known only as Jeanne was one of the leaders of the insurrection of June 5 (see here).

4. The setting up of Philippe V in Spain: a reference to the War of Spanish Succession (1701–14), when Louis XIV won a hugely expensive and bloody war against the English and their allies in order to affirm his grandson’s claim to the Spanish throne.

### 4.10.2: The Heart of the Matter
1. according to whether it is the king or the Convention … Bonaparte defends the true: On August 10, 1792, the Tuileries were invaded by a Parisian mob aided by the National Guard; the Swiss Guard was the royal family’s last line of defence. On Vendémiaire 14, Year IV (October 5, 1795), a royalist insurgency surrounded the Tuileries, then occupied by the Convention. General Bonaparte led the counterstrike, driving back 25,000 royalists with well-placed cannon fire.

2. Terray … Turgot: Joseph (l’abbé) Terray (1715–78), minister of finance for Louis XV from 1769 to 1774; like his successor, Turgot (see here), he attempted dramatic budgetary reforms, but without the innovations toward representative government that earned Turgot Hugo’s approbation.

3. Ramus assassinated by schoolboys: Petrus Ramus, or Pierre de La Ramée (1515–72), a humanist philosopher and theologian, was an enormously popular and controversial professor at the Sorbonne; having converted to Calvinism, he was murdered during the Saint Bartholomew’s Day Massacre, possibly by university students.

4. Rousseau driven out of Switzerland: Several of Rousseau’s books contained sharp critiques of organized religion that angered Catholics and Protestants; he emigrated to England from Switzerland in 1765 when that hostility led to, among other things, his house being pelted with stones.

5. Israel versus Moses … sailors versus Christopher Columbus: In the Old Testament (Numbers 16) a number of elders challenge the authority of Moses. On “Athens versus Phocion,” see here: “Rome versus Scipio”: probably a reference to Scipio Africanus, consul at the time of the Gracchi (see here), who was found murdered in his bed. “The soldiers versus Alexander”: Alexander the Great faced dissent among his officers and soldiers several times. “Sailors versus Christopher Columbus”: During Columbus’s first voyage, he faced a near munity from sailors who believed their ships were lost.

6. “Death to the Salt Taxes”: The gabelle, a tax on salt, was one of the most regressive and hated taxes of the ancien régime.

7. Saint Bartholomew killers … La Vendée is one big Catholic riot: On the Saint-Bartholomew’s Day massacres, see here. Those responsible for the massacres of the religious wars, like all those mentioned in these lines, were practising violence for dubious political causes. “September cutthroats”: the September massacres of the Revolution; one of the most famous victims was Marie Antoinette’s friend the princesse de Lamballe. “Avignon slaughterers”: see here. “Assassins of Coligny”: see here. “Assassins of Brune”: see here. The Miquelet militias were Spanish guerrillas who fought against Napoleonic forces. The Verdets and the Chevaliers du Brassard were royalists who took an active part in the Terreur blanche in the south of France; they took their name from the green (vert) cockades and armbands (brassards) they wore, the colour and symbol of the comte d’Artois, who was known to be more conservative than his brother the king. “Cadenette-wearing soldiers”: young royalists, fops, and Incroyables who practised clandestine violence on revolutionaries after the fall of Robespierre. “Companions of Jesus” (les compagnons de Jéhu; they apparently preferred an archaic spelling) were another group that made up the Terreur blanche. Hugo saw the Vendée in starkly different terms when younger.

8. Hébert versus Danton: Jacques-René Hébert (1757–94) was the leader of the enragé faction of the Revolution that attacked Danton under the Convention. Robespierre found Hébert a useful weapon against Danton, but when Hébert started attacking Robespierre, he was arrested and guillotined.

9. Polignac … Camille Desmoulins: Jules de Polignac (1780–1847) became prime minister to Charles X in August 1829. An Ultra of long standing (and the son of Marie Antoinette’s controversial favourite, the duchesse de Polignac), Polignac encouraged the king’s intransigance in the face of the Chamber of Deputies. He was seen as responsible for the July Ordinances that provoked the revolution of 1830. Camille Desmoulins (1760–94) became one of the leading orators of the Revolution; closely allied to Danton, he was arrested and executed with him in April 1794.

10. there was Juvenal: Juvenal (ca. 50–ca. 125) was the author of the Satires, which sharply critiqued all aspects of Roman society. He couched his political critiques by referring to past emperors, but they were sharp enough to bring about his exile to Syene, in Egypt (near modern Aswan).

11. the Gracchi: Roman brothers who attempted reforms to aid the poor; see here.

12. the man of the Annals: Tacitus, whose Annals offered a scathing indictment of the emperors from Tiberius to Nero.

13. the mighty exile of Patmos: traditionally believed to be Saint John the Evangelist, the author of the Book of Revelation (or Apocalypse), written while the author was living in exile on the Greek island of Patmos.

14. the Neros: i.e., the Caesars, of whom Nero was the last and worst of a corrupt line beginning with Tiberius.

15. The Ciceronian period: The Roman senator and orator Cicero solidified his public reputation as the prosecutor of Gaius Lucius Verres, accused of corruption while serving as governor of Sicily.

16. Tiberii: i.e., Tiberius and his successors Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, the subjects of Tacitus’s Annals.

17. the Sicilian pirates … the Rubicon: i.e., Caesar’s great achievements cover the sin of crossing the Rubicon with his armies to seize dictatorial powers and effectively end the Roman Republic.

18. Vitellius … Sulla: Vitellius (15–69) held the title of emperor for barely six months before being deposed and killed by the forces of Vespasian; Lucius Cornelius Sulla (138–78 B.C.E.), often called Sylla, used his military successes to seize power in Rome as dictator. He was in many ways a precursor of Julius Caesar.

19. Claudius and under Domitian: Many Roman historians portrayed Claudius (born 10 B.C.E., reigned 41–54) as weak and manipulated by his wives—including Messalina and Agrippina—and flatterers. Besides being an incompetent ruler, Domitian (born 51, reigned 81–96) was said to have persecuted Christians and Jews. Some believe the Book of Revelation was written under his reign, as a response to his persecutions.

20. Caracalla … Heliogabalus: Caracalla (born 186, reigned 211–217) was one of the most brutal of Roman rulers; Commodus (born 161, reigned 180–92) was known as a weak, capricious, and incompetent ruler; Heliogabalus (born 203, reigned 218–222) was known for his eccentric debauchery, and his cruelty became the stuff of legend.

21. Masaniello … Spartacus: Masaniello, or Tommaso Aniello (1622–47), was a fisherman who became the leader of a Neopolitan revolt against Spanish rule in 1647; he was eventually betrayed and assassinated by those who had been his followers, and the revolt failed. The legend of the gladiator-slave Spartacus (ca. 120–ca. 70 B.C.E.), who led a briefly successful slave revolt against the Roman government and army, was enormously popular with nineteenth-century liberals and revolutionaries.

22. Gaster: an allusion to Rabelais, who refers to the stomach as “Monsieur Gaster.”

23. Buzançais: In 1847, during a year of extremely poor harvests in France, a group of peasants attacked a landowner who refused to lower the price of his wheat. Three men were hanged as a result.

24. no Alps … the Asturias: The Jura Mountains in eastern France rise up against the Alps, much as the Asturias do in northern Spain against the larger and more imposing Pyrenees.

### 4.10.3: A Burial: An Occasion for Rebirth
1. Foy, his predecessor: Maximilien-Sébastien Foy (1775–1825), like Lamarque, rose up through the ranks to become a general and fought at Waterloo. In the Chamber of Deputies, Foy became an influential orator and leader of the liberal opposition. His funeral procession, like Lamarque’s seven years later, became the occasion for antigovernment protests.

2. the comte Gérard and the comte Drouet: Maurice-Étienne Gérard (1773–1852) and Jean-Baptiste Drouet (1765–1844) both rallied to Napoléon during the Hundred Days and fought at Waterloo. Both had significant political careers under the July Monarchy.

3. maréchaux in petto: meaning Napoléon had planned to promote them but had not yet done so.

4. The treaties of 1815: Following Napoléon’s return from Elba and Waterloo, the European allies demanded greater concessions from France in terms of territory, indemnity, and postwar occupation of France than they had in 1814.

5. the faubourg Saint-Antoine: Then on the eastern edge of Paris on the right bank (in today’s eleventh and twelfth Arrondissements), the faubourg Saint-Antoine was one of the poorest quarters of Paris. Its populace was associated with many of the journées of the French Revolution (including the taking of the Bastille, June 20 and August 10, 1792).

6. the sectionnaires: The sections were administrative districts of Paris drawn up by the Revolutionary governments, with names like Amis du peuple, les Piques, and les Brutus. The section meetings were used to rally crowds for demonstrations and insurrections. They were suppressed in 1795, in favour of the twelve arrondissements.

7. refugees of all nations: Lamarque was noted for his interest in the liberal movement across Europe (see here).

8. place Louis XV: In 1830, the great square between the Tuileries and the Champs-Élysées had been renamed the place de la Concorde.

9. legitimist intrigues … the duc de Reichstadt: i.e., Partisans of both the elder branch of the Bourbon family and Napoléon’s son (who died on July 22, 1832) saw a chance to retake the throne from Louis-Philippe.

10. the Vendôme column: A symbol of Napoleonic, and French, military glory, the great column in the place Vendôme was made from the bronze of Austrian and Russian cannons captured at Austerlitz and melted down. The Bourbons removed the statue of Napoléon from the top of the column in 1814. Hugo’s 1827 poem “Ode à la Colonne de Vendôme” is seen as an indicator of his shifting politics, from royalism to liberalism.

11. the duc de Fitz-James: Descended from the duke of Berwick, the illegitimate son of James II of England who took refuge in France in 1688, the Fitz-Jameses were one of the great families of the aristocracy. The duke’s refusal to remove his hat as the funeral procession passes is seen as a sign of disrespect.

12. the Gallic cock: adopted as a national symbol by the July Monarchy.

13. a red flag … a red cap: a symbol of republicanism, as the “pike topped a red cap,” the Phrygian cap, specifically recalled the bloodiest episodes of the Revolution of 1789–92.

14. Exelmans: Rémy-Joseph Exelmans (1775–1852) was known as one of the fiercest partisans of Napoléon. Louis-Napoléon would name him a marshal of France and senator of the Second Empire just before his death.

15. “Lamarque to the Panthéon!” “Lafayette to the Hôtel de Ville!”: The Panthéon had been redesignated a national mausoleum by the July Monarchy after having been restored to its religious function—as the church of Sainte-Geneviève—by the Bourbons. Lafayette’s public appearances at the Hôtel de Ville had been key moments in the revolutions of 1789 and 1830.

16. the narrow arm of the Seine: The small branch of the Seine between the right bank and the Île Louviers was filled in to create the quai Morland in 1847.

### 4.10.4: The Seething of Days Gone By
1. an imperceptible white stripe: i.e., the colour of the Bourbons, of royalism, is reduced to a bare minimum.

2. yataghans: long daggers with curved blades.

3. no. 50 … Jeanne and his one hundred and six companions: At 50, rue Saint-Merry (or Saint-Merri), at the intersection of the rue Saint-Martin, a worker whose name is recorded only as Jeanne led one of the strongest points of resistance to the National Guard. Jeanne and twenty other survivors were later deported.

4. the Hôtel Dieu … prefecture of police: a charity hospital founded in the seventh century; it was then housed in a building next to Notre-Dame, since destroyed by Haussmann’s renovations. The prefecture of police faces the cathedral.

5. the tocsin of Saint-Merry: i.e., an alarm signal was being rung with the bells of the church of Saint-Merry.

6. maréchal Soult: Nicolas-Jean de Dieu Soult (1769–1851), duc de Dalmatie, had been one of Napoléon’s closest generals. After a brief exile during the Restoration, he was restored to his military rank and named peer of France by Charles X in 1827; he served as minister of war (1830–34, 1840–45), minister of foreign affairs (1839–40), and twice as prime minister (1832–34, 1845–47) under Louis-Philippe.

### 4.10.5: Originality of Paris
1. In 1831: In February 1831, a memorial service for the assassinated duc de Berry provoked a Republican riot that culminated in the sacking of the archbishop’s palace on the Île de la Cité.

2. the insurrection of May 12, 1839: Under the leadership of Auguste Blanqui, several hundred socialists and republicans invaded the Hôtel de Ville; the insurrection lasted only a few hours.

3. Armand Carrel … maréchal Clauzel: Armand Carrel (1800–36), the editor and publisher of the liberal National, in fact did not support the insurrection of June 1832. Marshal Bertrand Clauzel (1772–1842) had served in the army with Lamarque and served as a pallbearer at his funeral. As implied by the reference to Anne Radcliffe below, Hugo is reporting rumours rather than facts.

4. that Anne Radcliffe: Anne Radcliffe (1764–1832) was one of the first and most successful of Gothic novelists. Her work was extremely popular in France.

5. Lobau and Bugeaud: Georges Mouton, marshal count Lobau (see here) was responsible for putting down the insurrections of the 1830s as commander of the National Guard. Thomas-Robert Bugeaud de la Piconnerie (1784–1849) was a general and deputy; placed in charge of a brigade of the National Guard during the insurrection of 1834, he earned the nickname “butcher of the rue Transnonain” (see here).

6. Lagrange, the man from Lyon: Charles Lagrange, one of the leaders of the silk workers’ insurrection of 1834 (see here).

## Book 11: The Atom Fraternizes With the Hurricane
### 4.11.1: Some Insights … on This Poetry
1. You can’t … Pointy-hatted hood!: “La nuit on ne voit rien, / Le jour on voit très bien, / D’un écrit apocryphe / Le bourgeois s’ébouriffe, / Pratiquez la vertu, / Tutu chapeau pointu!”

2. Monsieur Baour-Lormian: “one of the Forty,” i.e., a member of the Académie Française.

### 4.11.2: Gavroche on the March
1. “Let impure blood flood our furrows!”: “Qu’un sang impur abreuve nos sillons,” the last line of the chorus of the “Marseillaise.”

2. Scotland has its trios of witches: a reference to the “weird sisters” of Macbeth, Act I, scene iii: “All hail, Macbeth! thou shalt be king hereafter!”

3. the king of Rome … the duc de Bordeaux … Louis XVII: three heirs deprived of their birthright by revolution. On the king of Rome, see here. Charles X’s grandson, the posthumous son of the assassinated duc de Berry, had been named duc de Bordeaux by Louis XVIII; he was known to royalists as Henri V after his grandfather Charles X and his uncle, the duc d’Angoulême, abdicated. Louis XVII was a son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette.

4. the Hôtel Lamoignon: one of the great Renaissance town houses—hôtels particuliers—of the Marais; the Lamoignons were one of the most notable families of the noblesse de robe. It now houses the Bibliothèque Historique de la Ville de Paris.

### 4.11.3: A Wigmaker’s Just Indignation
1. Prudhomme: Henri Monnier’s satirical portrait of the typical Parisian bourgeois; see here.

2. “The emperor was only ever wounded once” … “At Ratisbon”: At the battle of Regensburg, Germany (Ratisbonne in French), in April 1809, Napoléon was struck in the heel by a Austrian bullet. Comparisons to Achilles were inevitable.

3. a Pindaric tone: Pindar was a lyric poet in Greece (fifth century B.C.E.).

### 4.11.4: The Boy Marvels at the Old Man
1. “Long live Poland!”: The cause of Polish independence was enormously popular among French liberals and romantics.

2. “para bellum”: from a Latin axiom, “Si vis pacem, para bellum”: “If you want peace, prepare for war.”

### 4.11.5: The Old Man
1. Here’s the moon … one boot: <br/>
Voici la lune qui paraît, <br/>
Quand irons-nous dans la forêt? <br/>
Demandait Charlot à Charlotte. <br/>
Tou tou tou <br/>
Pour Chatou. <br/>
Je n’ai qu’un Dieu, qu’un roi, qu’un liard et qu’une botte. <br/>
Pour avoir bu de grand matin <br/>
La rosée à même le thym, <br/>
Deux moineaux étaient en ribote. <br/>
Zi zi zi <br/>
Pour Passy. <br/>
Je n’ai qu’un Dieu, qu’un roi, qu’un liard et qu’une botte. <br/>
Et ces deux pauvres petits loups <br/>
Comme deux grives étaient soûls; <br/>
Un tigre en riait dans sa grotte. <br/>
Don don don <br/>
Pour Meudon. <br/>
Je n’ai qu’un Dieu, qu’un roi, qu’un liard et qu’une botte. <br/>
L’un jurait et l’autre sacrait. <br/>
Quand irons-nous dans la forêt? <br/>
Demandait Charlot à Charlotte. <br/>
Tin tin tin <br/>
Pour Pantin. <br/>
Je n’ai qu’un Dieu, qu’un roi, qu’un liard et qu’une botte. <br/>

## Book 12: Corinthe
1. Corinthe: after the ancient Greek city-state, one of the leaders of the cities allied against Spartan domination.

### 4.12.1: History of Corinthe from Its Foundation
1. Saint-Eustache … rue de la Petite-Truanderie: The rue Rambuteau was built in 1838–39. Many of the streets Hugo names still exist; the rue Saint-Denis, the rue de la Grande-Truanderie, and the rue du Cygne can easily be found on a map of Paris.

2. old Théophile: a probable allusion to the poet Théophile de Viau (1590–1626), but Yves Gohin has identifed the source of the couplet as Viau’s contemporary the poet Marc-Antoine de Saint-Amant (1594–1661).

3. Here bobs … hanged himself: “Là branle le squelette horrible / D’un pauvre amant qui se pendit.”

4. Mathurin Régnier: Another contemporary of Viau and Saint-Amant, Régnier (1573–1613) is best remembered for his Satires.

5. Natoire: Charles-Joseph Natoire (1700–77), a popular rococo painter.

6. She passes … into her mouth: “Elle étonne à dix pas, elle épouvante à deux, / Une verrue habite en son nez hasardeux; / On tremble à chaque instant qu’elle ne vous la mouche, / Et qu’un beau jour son nez ne tombe dans la bouche.”

7. “Revel if you can and eat if you dare”: A parody of a famous line from Corneille’s Héraclius: “Dévine, si tu peux, et choisis, si tu l’oses”—“Guess if you can, and choose if you dare.”

### 4.12.2: Preliminary Gaieties
1. hooded friars call bini: In certain monastic orders, lay brothers wore a hat instead of a cowel. Bini refers to two who share virtually everything.

2. “of the funeral orations”: Bossuet, the Eagle of Meaux, who gave Laigle his nickname, was known for his funeral orations (see here).

3. “That great mound of oyster shells”: i.e., the jaded cynic Grantaire, who has just eaten a bad oyster and who finds himself repulsed by erudition, sees the library as a pile of discarded, useless things. It is worth recalling here that even Grantaire is a reflection of some part of Victor Hugo. The Bibliothèque de France (now the Bibliothèque Nationale de France) was then located in the rue Richelieu, in a building that today still houses several collections of the BNF.

4. “The Gauls covet Clusium … the Sabines did to you”: The city-state of Clusium, in Tuscany, was an ally of Rome when the Gauls under the leadership of Brennus invaded Italy ca. 400 B.C.E. Brennus and his Gauls eventually conquered and sacked Rome. The Romans agreed to pay Brennus a ransom of one thousand pounds of gold in return for his evacuation. As the Gaulish general and the Roman leaders argued over the accuracy of the scales, Brennus threw his sword onto the balance and cried: “Vae victis!,” “Woe unto the vanquished!” The city of Alba, the tribes of the Fidenae, the Sabines, etc., were all victims of Rome’s military aggression.

5. “the lean cock … of Uri, or for the fat cock … of Glaris”: two Swiss cantons that, according to legend, decided a disputed border according to the crowing of cocks. The people of Uri did not feed their rooster, so it awoke and crowed earlier.

6. “Caesar dies … strikes him with a comet”: In the days following Caesar’s death, a comet was visible, seen as a sign of Caesar’s apotheosis.

7. “the comet of 1811”: The Great Comet of 1811 was visible to the naked eye for more than 250 days. It was seen in retrospect as an omen of Napoléon’s coming invasion of Russia.

8. “the hanging of the prince de Condé”: The scandalous life of the last prince de Condé, Louis VI Henri-Joseph de Bourbon-Condé (1756–1830), came to a mysterious end when he was found hanged in his château of Chantilly. The father of the duc d’Enghien (see here), he was a cousin of the Bourbons and an uncle of Louis-Philippe d’Orléans, a dissolute alcoholic with a fondness for inelegant prostitutes. Nonetheless, suspicion for his death fell on everyone from the royal family—whose son, the duc d’Aumale, became the richest individual in France upon his great-uncle’s death—to his last mistress, the former prostitute Madame la baronne de Feuchères, who inherited two million francs and several estates.

9. “a German princeling”: The minor princes of the three hundred–plus German principalities that made up the former Holy Roman Empire inspired a standard comic figure in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

10. “seraglios … odalisques”: Grantaire (or Hugo) seems to have confused his orientalist fantasies; the houri is usually the companion found in Paradise, while odalisques were found in seraglios (harems).

11. “the month of Prairial”: the early-summer month of the old revolutionary calendar, roughly May 20–June 18.

12. “Tymbraes Apollo”: i.e., “a mad Apollo.” Grantaire has made a Latinate pun based on the French word timbré, teched.

13. “Night, and Death … Psyche”: Psyche was so beautiful that Venus was jealous. It is unclear if Hugo is referring to a specific version of the story from Greek mythology or elaborating upon it.

### 4.12.3: Night Begins to Fall on Grantaire
1. “Non licet omnibus adire Corinthum”: a play on a verse from Horace: “It is not permitted to everyone [omnibus] to reach Corinth.”

2. “a Gothic Pygmalion”: The sculptor Pygmalion fell in love with his own statue Galatea. Venus took pity on him, answered his prayers, and brought the statue to life.

3. “Titian’s mistress”: Such famous paintings as Flora and A Young Woman at Her Toilet are believed to represent Titian’s mistress.

4. “I am Capitoul … of flower games”: The capitouls of Toulouse were the municipal magistrates of the city, elected from the most notable members of the bourgeoisie; although their functions were limited by the creation of a royal parlement, the Capitolum remained a very prestigious institution. “Flower games” refers to a prestigious poetry competition, dating back to the fourteenth century, held by the Académie des Jeux Floraux de Toulouse; in 1820, the eighteen-year-old Victor Hugo was named “maitre ès jeux” by the Académie, an honour he shared with Ronsard, Voltaire, and Chateaubriand.

5. died at Thermopylae … with Cromwell: On Leonidas and the battle of Thermopylae, see here. In 1649, Oliver Cromwell (1599–1658) led a Roundhead army into Ireland, where royalist partisans of Charles II had allied themselves with Catholic nationalists. He laid siege to the port town of Drogheda; when the town fell, Cromwell ordered his troops to kill every officer and every Catholic priest in the town.

### 4.12.6: While Waiting
1. This one:
Vous rappelez-vous notre douce vie,<br/>
Lorsque nous étions si jeunes tous deux, <br/>
Et que nous n’avions au cœur d’autre envie <br/>
Que d’être bien mis et d’être amoureux. <br/>
Lorsqu’en ajoutant votre âge a mon âge, <br/>
Nous ne comptions pas à deux quarante ans, <br/>
Et que, dans notre humble et petit ménage, <br/>
Tout, même l’hiver, nous était printemps? <br/>
Beaux jours! Manuel était fier et sage, <br/>
Paris s’asseyait à de saints banquets, <br/>
Foy lançait la foudre, et votre corsage <br/>
Avait une épingle où je me piquais. <br/>
Tout vous contemplait. Avocat sans causes, <br/>
Quand je vous menais au Prado dîner, <br/>
Vous étiez jolie au point que les roses <br/>
Me faisaient l’effet de se retourner. <br/>
Je les entendais dire: Est-elle belle! <br/>
Comme elle sent bon! quels cheveux à flots! <br/>
Sous son mantelet elle cache une aile; <br/>
Son bonnet charmant est à peine éclos. <br/>
J’errais avec toi, pressant ton bras souple. <br/>
Les passants croyaient que l’amour charmé <br/>
Avait marié, dans notre heureux couple, <br/>
Le doux mois d’avril au beau mois de mai. <br/>
Nous vivions cachés, contents, porte close, <br/>
Dévorant l’amour, bon fruit défendu; <br/>
Ma bouche n’avait pas dit une chose <br/>
Que déja ton cœur avait répondu. <br/>
La Sorbonne était l’endroit bucolique <br/>
Où je t’adorais du soir au matin. <br/>
C’est ainsi qu’une âme amoureuse applique <br/>
La carte du Tendre au pays latin. <br/>
O place Maubert! O place Dauphine! <br/>
Quand, dans le taudis frais et printanier, <br/>
Tu tirais ton bas sur ta jambe fine, <br/>
Je voyais un astre au fond du grenier. <br/>
J’ai fort lu Platon, mais rien ne m’en reste <br/>
Mieux que Malebranche et que Lamennais; <br/>
Tu me démontrais la bonté céleste <br/>
Avec une fleur que tu me donnais. <br/>
Je t’obéissais, tu m’étais soumise. <br/>
O grenier doré! te lacer! te voir! <br/>
Aller et venir des l’aube en chemise, <br/>
Mirant ton front jeune à ton vieux miroir! <br/>
Et qui donc pourrait perdre la mémoire <br/>
De ces temps d’aurore et de firmament, <br/>
De rubans, de fleurs, de gaze et de moire, <br/>
Où l’amour bégaye un argot charmant? <br/>
Nos jardins étaient un pot de tulipe; <br/>
Tu masquais la vitre avec un jupon; <br/>
Je prenais le bol de terre de pipe, <br/>
Et je te donnais la tasse en japon. <br/>
Et ces grands malheurs qui nous faisaient rire! <br/>
Ton manchon brûlé, ton boa perdu! <br/>
Et ce cher portrait du divin Shakspeare <br/>
Qu’un soir pour souper nous avons vendu! <br/>
J’étais mendiant, et toi charitable; <br/>
Je baisais au vol tes bras frais et ronds. <br/>
Dante in-folio nous servait de table <br/>
Pour manger gaîment un cent de marrons. <br/>
Le première fois qu’en mon joyeux bouge <br/>
Je pris un baiser à ta lèvre en feu, <br/>
Quand tu t’en allas décoiffée et rouge, <br/>
Je restai tout pâle et je crus en Dieu! <br/>
Te rappeles-tu nos bonheurs sans nombre, <br/>
Et tous ces fichus changés en chiffons? <br/>
Oh! que de soupirs, de nos cœrs pleins d’ombre, <br/>
Se sont envolés dans les cieux profonds! <br/>

2. The Tender card: The Carte du Tendre, the Map of the Tender, i.e., an allegorical map of tender sentiments, was an invention of the seventeenth-century précieuses; see here.

3. Malebranche and Lamennais: two important Catholic philosophers, Nicolas Malebranche (1638–1715) and Félicité de Lamennais (1782–1854).

### 4.12.8: Several Question Marks Regarding a Man Named Le Cabuc Who Was Perhaps Not Le Cabuc
1. the Themis of antiquity: the goddess of justice.

2. “no more Satan … no more Michael”: i.e., when the progess of humanity and the human spirit has brought an end to evil, there will no longer be a need for God’s warrior, Michael, the avenging archangel.

## Book 13: Marius Steps Into the Shadows
### 4.13.1: From the Rue Plumet to the Quartier Saint-Denis
1. Black coats and round hats … caked with dirt: i.e., the bourgeoisie had given way to the working class.

### 4.13.3: The Extreme Edge
1. no longer Montmirail or Champaubert: two battles during the defensive French campaign of 1814; Colonel Pontmercy fought at Montmirail, but no mention is made of Champaubert.

2. Timoleon versus the tyrant: The fourth-century-B.C.E. Corinthian politician and general travelled to Syracuse, in Sicily, in order to help liberate the city from the tyrant Hicetas, who was backed by Carthage.

3. Brutus … Coligny: Brutus was the executioner of Julius Caesar. Étienne Marcel (ca. 1315–1358) was the Parisian official (provost of merchants) who led the Estates General as a member of the Third Estate in 1355 and ’56. Arnold of Blankenheim may be a reference to a leader of the Swiss revolt against the Hapsburgs. Gaspard de Coligny was a leader of the Protestant faction during the Wars of Religion, killed during the Saint Bartholomew’s Day Massacre.

4. Ambiorix, by Artevelde, by Marnix, by Pelagius: Ambiorix led the Gauls against Caesar and the Roman legions. Jacques d’Artevelde (or Jakob van Artevelde) (ca. 1285–1345) led the Flemish against French domination. Philippe de Marnix (1540–98) led the Dutch in a revolt against Spanish rule. Pelagius, king of Asturias in northern Spain, fought against the Moorish invasion of the eighth century.

5. drive out the Englishman: perhaps a reference to Joan of Arc, or to Colonel Pontmercy fighting against Wellington.

6. Prometheus Bound begins, Aristogeiten ends: In Aeschylus’s play Prometheus Bound, the Titan who gave fire to mortals in defiance of the gods and was in punishment chained to a mountainside, where vultures pecked at his liver, is presented as a rebel against the unreasonable authority of Zeus. The theme of the rebel Titan captured the Romantic imaginations of Goethe, Byron, and Shelley. Hugo attributes the overthrow of the tyrant Hipparchus by the Aristogeiten and Harmodius (see here) to the influence of Aeschylus, but it appears that the play was written after Hipparchus’s assassination.

7. Thrasybulus: general who overthrew the Athenian oligarchy and restored democracy in 411 B.C.E. Hugo compares the effect of Diderot and the Enlightenment on the Revolution, when writers (poets) lit the way for politicians, to the ancient Greeks.

8. “because he is a Bourbon”: “parce qu’il est Bourbon,” given as the ultimate rationale for the execution of Louis XVI. He was guilty of tyranny simply because he was a Bourbon.

## Book 14: The Grandeurs of Despair
### 4.14.1: The Flag—Act One
1. Here come the suburbs: Gavroche, the proud Parisian, mocks the National Guard troops from the suburbs who have come under General Bugeaud to fight against Parisians.

2. My nose … Cock-a-doodle-do: “Mon nez est en larmes, / Mon ami Bugeaud, / Prêt-moi tes gendarmes / Pour leur dire un mot. / Encapote bleue, / La poule au shako, / Voici la banlieue! / Co-cocorico!”

3. the statue of the Commendatore: a reference to Mozart’s Don Giovanni, in which the statue-ghost of the commendatore avenges Don Giovanni’s seduction of his daughter by dragging the libertine down to hell.

### 4.14.6: The Agony of Death After the Agony of Life
1. At the sight … Run! he said: “En voyant Lafayette / Le gendarme répète / Sauvons-nous! sauvons-nous! sauvons-nous!”

### 4.14.7: Gavroche a Profound Calculator of Distances
1. “I’ll be back in plenty of time”: At this point in the manuscript, a note of Hugo’s reads, “Here the Peer of France interrupted [his writing], and the exile continued: 30 December, 1860, Guernsey.”

## Book 15: The Rue de L’Homme-Armé
### 4.15.4: Gavroche’s Excessive Zeal
1. The bird … Lon la:<br/>
L’oiseau médit dans les charmilles, <br/>
Et prétend qu’hier Atala <br/>
Avec un russe s’en alla. <br/>
Où vont les belles filles, <br/>
Lon la. <br/>

Mon cœur un beau jour s’envola; <br/>
Je crois que c’est Jeanne qui l’a.   Où vont, etc. <br/>
Le soir, en sortant des quadrilles, <br/>
Je morte aux étoiles Stella <br/>
Et je leur dis; regardez-la.   Où vont, etc. <br/>

2. But there are … Lon la: <br/>
Mais il reste encor des bastilles, <br/>
Et je vais mettre le holà <br/>
Dans l’ordre public que voilà <br/>
Où vont les belles filles, <br/>
Lon la <br/>

# Part 5: Jean Valjean
## Book 1: War Between Four Walls
### 5.1.1: The Charybdis of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine and the Scylla of the Faubourg du Temple
1. Charybdis … Scylla: in Greek mythology, two monsters who lived on either side of a narrow, dangerous passage, traditionally located in the Strait of Messina between Italy and Sicily. Scylla lived on the rocks, Charybdis in a whirlpool.

2. the fatal insurrection of June 1848: The July Monarchy had fallen in February, and Victor Hugo had been elected to the Constituent Assembly of the new republic. On June 23, after a turbulent spring, widespread unemployment led to a revolt of Parisian workers in the northern and eastern parts of the city. Barricades were erected in the faubourgs Saint-Denis, Saint-Antoine, and Saint-Jacques. Insurgents broke into the Hugos’ apartment in the place des Vosges, intending to loot and burn it, but stopped when they learned whose home it was. The repression of the riots was chiefly the responsibility of General Cavaignac, but Hugo, as a member of the legislative committee appointed to oversee the reestablishment of order, took an active part in the government’s counterinsurgency efforts, even accompanying troops to the barricaded streets. By midnight of June 26, the insurgency was effectively crushed. An estimated 1,500 insurgents had been killed; 15,000 more would be deported.

3. mob rule rises up against the Demos: Hugo draws a distinction between the mob, or ochlocracy—a Renaissance neologism based on ancient Greek—and the orderly rule of the demos/democracy. As with the distinction between plebs and the people, the difference is fine and based on circumstance.

4. Saint Jerome … Fex urbis, lex orbis: “From the dregs of the city comes the law of the world.” Saint Jerome (ca. 342–419) is one of the Fathers of the Roman and Eastern Churches. His translation of the Bible from Greek into Latin formed the basis of the Vulgate Bible of the Roman Catholic Church.

5. the fearful square that witnessed July 14: The place de la Bastille was traditionally the western boundary of the faubourg Saint-Antoine.

6. Sisyphus … pottery: symbols of great suffering. Sisyphus was condemned to roll a rock up a hill every day; when he reached the top of the hill, the rock would roll down and he would start again. In the Book of Job (2:7–9), Satan afflicts Job with terrible sores; Job’s faith is unshaken as he takes up a “shard of pottery” to scrape his skin.

7. Ossa heaped upon the Pelion: two mountains in Greece; in mythology, the rebellious young giants Otus and Elphiates put Mount Pelion on top of Mount Ossa in an attempt to reach Olympus but were killed by Apollo before reaching the home of the gods; to put Pelion on top of Ossa proverbially refers to a massive but futile effort.

8. Thermidor 9 … Prairial: Thermidor 9 was the date of the coup d’état against Robespierre (July 28, 1794). For “August 10,” see here. “Brumaire 18” refers to Bonaparte’s 1799 coup d’état, and “January 21” to the execution of Louis XVI. “Vendémiaire” refers to the attempted royalist insurrection of October 5, 1795, and “Prairial” to the Jacobins’ triumph over the Girondins in the spring of 1793.

9. it was Sinai: It was at the top of Mount Sinai that God spoke to Moses and gave him the Ten Commandments (Exodus 19–24).

10. the “Carmagnole” … the “Marseillaise”: Two revolutionary songs: “La Marseillaise” had been banned by the Empire and Restoration governments after having been the national anthem from 1795 to 1804; the July Monarchy put an end to legal interdictions, but the song would not become the national anthem again until the Third Republic of 1870. The “Carmagnole,” more specifically antiroyalist than the “Marseillaise,” which calls for the defence of the patrie, never had any official status; new verses were written during the successive revolutions and insurrections of the nineteenth century.

11. the generals of Africa: In 1848, the generals who put down the June insurrection had made their military reputations in Algeria, most notably Louis Eugène Cavaignac (1802–57).

12. Zaatcha and Constantine: two battles the French fought against Algerian resistance, Constantine in 1836 and Zaatcha in 1849.

13. Cournet, the other Barthélemy: Frédéric Cournet (1801–52) was a naval officer who became involved in politics after he retired; Emmanuel Barthélemy had, as Hugo relates, a less savoury history. The two men were both living in exile in London, where Barthélemy insulted Cournet, provoking the duel that killed the latter. Barthélemy was later convicted of killing two people in that mysterious, passionate adventure Hugo alludes to and was hanged in London.

### 5.1.2: What Is There to Do in a Bottomless Pit but Talk?
1. “Harmodius … Sand”: On Harmodius and Aristogeiton, see here; Brutus led the Roman senators who assassinated Caesar. Chereas was one of the Praetorian guards who assassinated Caligula. Stephanus assassinated the emperor Domitian (see here). Cromwell, as the leader of the Puritan or Roundhead rebels of the English rebellion, bore the greatest responsibility for the death of King Charles I in 1649. Charlotte Corday assassinated the Revolutionary leader Jean-Paul Marat in 1793. The German nationalist Ludwig Sand (1795–1820) murdered the German playwright (and Russian agent) August von Kotzebue in 1819.

2. the Georgics: Virgil’s poetic celebration of rural life and a frequent point of reference for Hugo, who was no doubt familiar with each of the early-nineteenth-century translations Combeferre names.

3. “Zoïlus insults Homer … Fréron insults Voltaire”: Zoïlus (fourth century B.C.E.) was one of the earliest critics of Homer; Maevius was a hostile contemporary critic of Virgil, known only because Virgil and Horace mockingly answered his criticisms. Jean Donneau de Visé (1638–1710), a minor playwright and critic, was hostile to Molière and Racine but, like Hugo, a great admirer of Corneille. Alexander Pope (1688–1744) published an edition of Shakespeare’s plays that included corrections of the poetic meter and rewrites of certain verses, which could certainly be taken as an insult. The journalist and critic Élie Fréron (1718–76) conducted a long and public battle with Voltaire.

4. “that rapist of the Rubicon”: Caesar’s crossing of the Rubicon with his armies violated Roman law and tradition; it was the irrevocable step in bringing the Roman Republic to an end with Caesar’s dictatorship.

5. “Eutropius”: a fourth-century Roman historian, the author of Breviarium historiae Romanae, widely read by Latin scholars from the Middle Ages onward.

6. “O Cydathenaeum … from Edapteon”: cities of ancient Greece. Bossuet seems to be mocking the bourgeois, who do not know what he is talking about, and himself and his friends, who do.

### 5.1.4: Five Fewer, One More
1. “Saint-Lazare”: a women’s prison, frequently used to incarcerate prostitutes.

2. “the Necker hospice”: a hospital built by Jacques Necker (1732–1804), the father of Madame de Staël and Louis XVI’s minister of finance (1776–81 and 1788–90), and his wife, Suzanne (1739–94), who was known for her generosity to charity hospitals.

3. “universal suffrage”: Hugo was an advocate of universal suffrage under the ephemeral Second Republic.

### 5.1.5: The View from the Top of the Barricade
1. Saint-Just … Anacharsis Clootz: Saint-Just, an acolyte of Robespierre, was too devoted to the ideology of revolution and not enough to the benefits revolution offered to mankind. The Prussian nobleman Jean-Baptiste Clootz (1755–94), who took the name Anarcharis when he emigrated to Paris to join the French Revolution and proclaimed himself “orator of mankind,” advocated international revolution for the benefit of all mankind. Clootz’s militant atheism offended Robespierre, who sent him to the guillotine with the Hébertists (see here).

2. “The Amphictyons”: The Amphictyons were representatives of the leading Greek city-states who met to decide common religious festivals and military concerns. The numerous wars between the cities involved belie the notion that this was a model for European cooperation.

### 5.1.7: The Situation Gets Worse
1. the avenue of the Sphinxes in Thebes: The road from Luxor Temple to Karnak Temple in Thebes is lined with statues of sphinxes.

2. a Voltaire armchair: a low armchair with a high, reclining backrest, so named in the early nineteenth century by an anonymous pioneer in the art of marketing.

### 5.1.12: Disorder, a Supporter of Order
1. Fannicot … Henri Fonfrède: Henri Fonfrède was the son of Conventionist, a journalist who opposed the Bourbon Restoration, and loyal supporter of the July Monarchy as a constitutional monarchy. He spent most of his life and career in Bordeaux, only briefly attempting to launch a Parisian newspaper in 1836. The story of National Guard Captain Fannicot is given according to Hugo’s reading of the government account of the June insurrection.

2. lynch law: perhaps from Colonel William Lynch, a Virginia politician of the Revolutionary era who practised summary justice with the approval of the Virginia General Assembly; the term came to be used to describe the practice of vigilantism more generally.

3. Paul-Aimé Garnier: Hugo ascribes to a young poet (1820–46) of his acquaintance a nearly tragic but comic episode of his own life, as he walked home during the 1834 insurrection holding a volume of the seventeenth-century memorialist and was mistaken for a follower of the nineteenth-century utopian social reformer (see here). Number 6 place Royale (called the place des Vosges since 1848) was the residence of the Hugos from 1832 to 1848; the house now contains the Victor Hugo Museum.

4. condottiere: after the legendary companies of mercenaries of fifteenth-and sixteenth-century Italy.

5. Vincennes: a medieval château on the western edge of Paris, officially a royal residence, used largely as a prison and arsenal from the seventeenth century on.

6. the quid divinum: the “divine thing.”

7. an August 10 … a July 29: the coups d’états that brought down Louis XVI (August 10, 1792) and his brother Charles X (July 29, 1830), respectively.

### 5.1.13: Passing Glimmers
1. General Cavaignac de Baragne: Jacques-Marie, Vicomte de Cavaignac and Baron de Baragne, the uncle of Louis-Eugène de Cavaignac, who was the head of the National Guard in 1848 (see here).

2. Suchet’s Saragossa dictum: On the difficulties of the French army in Spain, see here.

### 5.1.14: In Which You Will Read the Name of Enjolras’ Mistress
1. Madame Scarron: Before she became the pious and morganatic wife of Louis XIV, Françoise d’Aubigné (1635–1719) was married to the impoverished but witty poet Paul Scarron (1610–1660) and served as hostess in his salon. After Scarron died, she was named governess of the bastard children of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. The king granted her the title of marquise de Maintenon, the name by which she is best known.

2. Roland … Angélique: names typical of young lovers in romantic novels.

### 5.1.15: Gavroche Outside
1. the fault of Voltaire: Gavroche’s song mocks the conservatives who blame the Enlightenment and the Revolution for all the ills of society, firing mockery back at the armed bourgeois. Hugo wrote the lyrics following an 1817 song by Bérenger.

2. They’re ugly … of Rousseau: “On est laid à Nanterre / C’est la faute à Voltaire, / Et bête à Palaiseau, / C’est la faute à Rousseau.”

3. I am not … of Rousseau: “Je ne suis pas notaire, / C’est la faute à Voltaire; / Je suis petit oiseau, / C’est la faute à Rousseau.”

4. Joy is … of Rousseau: “Joie est mon caractère, / C’est la faute à Voltaire; / Misère est mon trousseau, / C’est la faute à Rousseau.”

5. I fell … fault of—: “Je suis tombé par terre, / C’est la faute à Voltaire, / La nez dans le ruisseau, / C’est la faute à—”

### 5.1.16: How You Go from Being a Brother to a Father
1. invenerunt parvulum pannis involutum: Luke 2:12: “And they found a little child wrapped in swaddling clothes” (Hugo inadvertently changed the Latin future tense to the past), the inscription on the Hôpital Saint-Vincent-de-Paul (see here), an orphanage that then stood in the avenue Denfert-Rochereau.

2. Aldebaran: the brightest star in the constellation Taurus, sometimes called the Bull’s-Eye. Aldebaran was also, in a noncanonical tradition, a fallen angel.

3. Vulcan: i.e., Hephestes, the ugly, misshapen god of volcanoes and fire. The blacksmith of Olympus was also the god of iron, arms, and armour.

4. Solem quis dicere falsum audeat?: “Who would dare to say that the sun is deceitful?” from Virgil’s Georgics.

5. Marie de Médicis: The Florentine Marie de Médicis, queen of Henri IV and mother of Louis XIII, built the Luxembourg palace and gardens for her Parisian residence; they were completed in 1625.

6. “saturnalia”: i.e., an immoral celebration, comparable for this prudhommesque bourgeois to a Roman orgy.

7. “separates royalty from the peerage”: The Luxembourg was the meeting place of the Chamber of Peers.

8. “The younger branch is doomed”: Louis-Philippe and the Orléans family were descended from the duc d’Orléans, younger brother of Louis XIV, thus the “younger branch” of the royal family.

### 5.1.17: Mortuus Pater Filium Moriturum Expectat
1. Mortuus … expectat: “The dead father awaits the son who is also to die.”

### 5.1.18: The Vulture Turns into the Prey
1. Monsieur de Clermont-Tonnerre: The comte de Clermont-Tonnerre was minister of war from 1823 to 1827.

### 5.1.20: The Dead Are Right but the Living Are Not Wrong
1. turning from Minerva to Pallas: The goddess of wisdom gained the name Pallas when she killed a giant (in some versions a Titan identified with war) and took his name as one of her own.

2. Gérard de Nerval: a poet and writer (1802–55).

3. John Brown … Garibaldi: John Brown (1800–59) was hanged after leading an unsuccessful attack on Harper’s Ferry. Carlo Pisacane (1818–57) was killed in an attempted republican revolt in the Kingdom of Naples; Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807–82), the primary military leader of the Risorgimento, lived largely in retirement once unification was achieved.

4. not Don Quixote … but Leonidas: i.e., not the delusional would-be knight of Cervantes tilting at windmills but Leonidas, who leads his men to inevitable but honourable defeat.

5. Vitae lampada tradunt!: “They pass the torch of life from one to another!”; an allusion to a poem by Lucretius.

6. Corinth, yes; Sybaris, no: The Greek city-states of Corinth and Sybaris grew rich from trade, but while the Sybarites fell into luxurious decadence, the Corinthians remained honourable and virile. The adjective sybaritic comes from the legend of Sybaris.

7. Missouri or a South Carolina: The choice of two slave states is almost certainly a reflection of Hugo’s growing interest in the question of emancipation throughout the 1850s.

### 5.1.21: Heroes
1. the dash of a Zouave: Taking their name from a Berber tribe that had allied with the French in Algeria, the Zouaves were an elite unit of infantry in the French army.

2. “Does anyone” … from the old army: Hugo’s unwonted reluctance to name names is intriguing.

3. the Veda: the sacred texts of Hinduism.

4. François I had at Marignano: The French victory under Francis I at Marignan (Marignano, Italy) led the way to the French capture of Milan.

5. “Then Diomed … River Satnois”: from the Iliad. This passage is not a quote but a summary of characters and events in Homer’s epic.

6. Esplandian attacks … towers he uproots: a story taken from a Spanish novel of the sixteenth century.

7. the two ducs: Hugo’s romantic image of a chivalric battle (or tournament) seems to refer to the early Middle Ages, when Bretagne (Brittany) was independent of the French crown.

8. Yvon: a Breton spelling of Yves.

9. Phyles … Euphetes: more allusions to heroes of the Iliad, as are Megaryon and Ajax below.

### 5.1.22: Inch by Inch
1. Greek fire … Bayard: Among the weapons the ancient Greek scientist Archimedes is credited with inventing is Greek fire, a flaming liquid that could be projected onto enemy ships. Boiling pitch, or tar, was frequently used as a defensive weapon in the time of Pierre Terrail, the chevalier Bayard (1476–1524), the French military hero who epitomized the martial virtues of the early Renaissance.

2. Milton and Dante than Homer: i.e., more like a vision of hell than a tale of heroic military action.

### 5.1.23: Orestes on a Fast and Pylades Drunk
1. Orestes … Pylades: the archetypal male friendship of Orestes (the abstemious Enjolras) and Pylades (the drunken Grantaire).

## Book 2: Leviathan’s Bowels
1. Leviathan’s: Leviathan was a biblical sea monster, variously described as a great serpent and a great fish.

### 5.2.1: Land Impoverished by the Sea
1. Eckeberg: Captain Charles Gustav Eckeberg (1716–84), a Swedish officer who wrote a book entitled The Art of Chinese Husbandry.

2. Folie Beaujon: The house and gardens of the financier Nicolas Beaujon were famous for their extravagance. see here.

3. Saint-Cloud nets: Downriver from Paris, nets were set up to prevent large objects, including bodies, from floating downriver and obstructing navigation.

4. Fuhkien: or Fujian, a province in southern China.

5. Liebig: Justus Liebig (1803–73), a German chemist who specialized in agricultural methods.

6. Urbi et orbi: “To the city and to the world.”

7. if Paris contains … Lutetia: Tyre was the capital of the commercial empire of the ancient Phoenicians; Nineveh was the capital of the Assyrian empire; Lutetia, the Latin name for the city that became Paris (Lutèce in French) was believed to come from the Latin lutum, mud.

8. Machiavelli, Bacon, and Mirabeau: historical figures of combined genius and moral corruption: Machiavelli’s The Prince made his name a byword for political cynicism (see here); the English essayist, scientist, and political philosopher Francis Bacon (1561–1626) had an equivocal reputation ranging from an arrest for debts to a history of opportunism to his sex life; Honoré-Gabriel de Mirabeau’s scandalous personal life preceded his reputation as a statesman.

### 5.2.2: The Ancient History of the Sewer
1. Benares … Babylon: Benares is the modern city of Varanasi in India; “the lion’s den of Babylon” refers to the Book of Daniel, when the prophet is cast into a pit of lions for refusing to renounce God and is miraculously protected from harm.

2. Tiglath-Pileser … his fake sun: Tiglath-Pileser was the name of three Assyrian kings; the source of Hugo’s assertion about “the sink of Nineveh” cannot be found. Jan van Leyden (ca. 1510–36) was a leader of the Anabaptist movement, an eccentric who claimed the city of Münster was the kingdom of Zion and he was king. The eighth-century Persian prophet Mokanna (or al-Muqanna) claimed to be the reincarnation of God and wore a veil because (he claimed) his face emitted rays of light as powerful as the sun.

3. Gemoniae: On the Gemonian Staircase in Rome, see here.

4. Maillotins: The Maillotins were a group who rebelled against taxation in the late fourteenth century.

5. Morin’s visionary Illuminati: Simon Morin, a mystic and minor writer, became convinced he was the son of God. He was arrested and burned at the stake in 1663. His followers—les illuminés—are not related to the Bavarian Illuminati of the following century.

6. Chauffeurs: From the French verb chauffer, “to heat,” chauffeurs practised political terror in Brittany and the Vendée during the Revolution, and various groups, including the bandit chief Schinderhannes, extorted money from their victims by literally holding their feet to the fire.

7. that Gallic picareria: from the Spanish picaro, adventurer, Hugo’s apparent neologism refers to a collection of vagrants (truands) and petty thieves.

8. the Cour des Miracles: see here.

9. Villon … Rabelais: i.e., the criminal-poet Villon lived outside the law, whereas the humanist Rabelais lived and wrote near but within its edges.

10. Basil’s mask … Scapin’s false nose: Basil and Scapin were traditional names for farcical characters in popular theatre, cunning or cowardly valets and peasants. Their masks refer to the tradition of the Italian commedia dell’arte.

11. Caïaphas’s … vomit: i.e., the sacred meets the profane. When Christ was brought before the Jewish high priest Caiaphas for trial, he was spit upon by Caiaphas’s soldiers, not the priest himself; Falstaff is the cheerful drunk of Shakespeare’s Henry IV and Henry V.

12. The Saint Bartholomews: the Saint Bartholomew’s Day massacre and similar acts of political violence.

13. Louis XI … Louvois: The darker legends of French kings are presented along with their advisers, their âmes damnés in French. The Spider King, Louis XI, loomed large in the romantic imagination as a cruel, even sadistic figure (in Notre-Dame de Paris, he is depicted taunting Cardinal Balue, who languishes in an iron cage). The king’s adviser, Tristan l’Hermite, is portrayed as his henchman. Antoine Duprat (1463–1535) was the detested adviser of François I, known for his aggressive taxation and harsh persecution of Protestants; Hugo’s portrayal of François I in Le Roi s’amuse (The King Takes His Pleasure) as a corrupt and dissolute monarch abusing his authority was a far cry from the usual portrayal of François as a gallant Renaissance prince. Charles IX (born 1550, reigned 1560–74) is popularly portrayed as the weak and vacillating puppet of his domineering mother, Catherine de Médicis (1519–89), who has been held responsible for the Saint Bartholomew’s Day Massacre of 1572. Cardinal de Richelieu dominated the reign of Louis XIII and ruthlessly crushed opposition to royal authority. Louvois and Letellier were advisers of Louis XIV who promoted harsh policies against the Protestant Huguenots (see here).

14. Hébert and Maillard: The revolutionaries are linked with the royal malefactors above chiefly for their part in the September massacres.

15. the Jewry of the Ghetto: Hugo refers to the original Ghetto, the Jewish quarter in Venice, and the Judengasse of German cities.

16. the mark of Messalina’s dig: the legendary sexual appetite of Claudius’s empress Messalina fascinated Hugo, among others.

### 5.2.3: Bruneseau
1. Henri II: son of François I, husband of Catherine de Médicis, and father of the last three Valois kings of France (born 1519, reigned 1547–59).

2. Mercier: Louis-Sébastien Mercier (1740–1814), a prolific author best remembered for his Tableau de Paris, in which he examined virtually every observable facet of Paris society, from the highest to the lowest.

3. Daedalus replicated Babel: Daedalus, the father of Icarus, designed the Labyrinth of Crete, where the Minotaur was kept. Babel was the site of the tower men built in an attempt to reach heaven; the arrogance of the effort angered God, who destroyed the tower and invented different languages so that mankind could never cooperate on such a venture again.

4. Behemoth: from the Book of Job. Behemoth is the largest, fiercest animal of the land, as Leviathan (see here) is the largest and most fearsome creature in the sea.

5. Sainte-Foix … Créqui: two notoriously libertine aristocrats of the late eighteenth century.

6. The Goblin Monk: a Parisian ghost story dating back at least to the seventeenth century; a ghost or demon who walked the streets at night.

7. Marmousets: derisive but undeserved nickname given to the counsellors of King Charles VI, known as Charles the Mad (born 1368, reigned 1380–1422).

J’adore son jupon, <br/>
Fripon. <br/>
Amour, tu vis en elle; <br/>
Car c’est dans sa prunelle <br/>
Que tu mets ton carquois, <br/>
Narquois! <br/>
Moi, je la chante, et j’aime, <br/>
Plus que Diane même, <br/>
Jeanne et ses durs tetons <br/>
Bretons.

### 5.5.3: Marius Attacks
1. “the Regency”: The Regency (1715–23), the period when Philippe d’Orléans (1674–1723), a nephew of Louis XIV, ruled France in the name of the five-year-old Louis XV (born 1710, reigned 1715–1774), great-grandson of the Sun King, was remembered as a time of great libertinage. Monsieur Gillenormand is not old enough to have seen the Regency, though he strives to keep its spirit alive.

2. “Dorante … Géronte”: traditional names of youth (Dorante) and old age (Géronte) in traditional French comedy.

3. “André Chénier”: The royalist Gillenormand and his Romantic grandson can find common ground in the poetry of Chénier (see here).

4. “Thermidor”: Chénier was in fact guillotined on 7 Thermidor, Year II (July 25, 1794), only two days before Robespierre himself was arrested in the coup of 9 Thermidor.

### 5.5.4: Mademoiselle Gillenormand … Under His Arm
1. “Monsieur Boulard”: probably Antoine-Marie-Henri Boulard (1754–1825); a Parisian lawyer and friend of many philosophes, he left a library of five hundred thousand volumes.

2. Father Gillenormand … aristocratic way of his: The inability, real or affected, to correctly recall a social inferior’s name is a trope of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century French literature.

3. “a Greuze”: see here.

4. “a certain Saint Catherine”: Traditionally, an unmarried woman was said to “take Saint Catherine’s veil” at age twenty-five, a reference to her quasi-official status as an old maid.

6. “sorority of the Virgin”: one of the lay religious organizations that were very popular during the July Monarchy.

### 5.5.6: The Two Old Men … Cosette Is Happy
1. “Strasbourg cathedral a clock”: The famous astronomical clock of Strasbourg Cathedral dates from the sixteenth century.

2. “Phoebus and Phoebe”: alternative names for Apollo, god of the sun, and Artemis, goddess of the moon. The names derive from the Greek word for “light” or “pure.”

3. “Charles V”: see here.

4. “Éponine and Sabinus”: The Gaulish chieftain Sabinus led a revolt against Roman occupation in the year 68, after which he hid in the forest for nine years. His wife, Éponine, protected and supplied him in his hiding places. Both were captured, then publicly tortured and executed by the emperor Vespasian, as an example to Roman subjects.

5. “Old Grigou … old maid Grippesou”: traditional names for misers. Grippesou means “penny-pincher.”

7. “Longchamp”: The racetrack at Longchamp was a gathering place for Parisian high society from the mid-eighteeth century.

8. “The Trojan War … Helen’s garter”: Monsieur Gillenormand recalls Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey to pay a compliment to Cosette.

9. “Nestor”: In the Iliad, Nestor is a counsellor to younger warriors and a generous host to Odysseus’s son Telemachus.

10. “a good solid contract”: By tradition and by law, marriage contracts were standard in France. Under the ancien régime, among families with means, the signing of the marriage contract was a ceremony in itself, hence the “good solid spread.”

11. “Cujas … Gamache”: Jacques Cujas (1520–90) was a great legal scholar of the Renaissance; Gamache is a character in Don Quixote associated with a wedding party. Monsieur Gillenormand advocates a festive celebration once the legal formalities of marriage are disposed of.

12. “Florian”: from the Latin word for flowers; even soldiers were poetic. Edmond Rostand’s Cyrano de Bergerac, a swordsman and poet, is probably the best-known incarnation of this very French archetype.

14. “Monsieur Royer-Collard”: The constitutional monarchist Pierre-Paul Royer-Collard (1763–1845) was a highly respected scholar, philosopher, and politician. Naturally, Monsieur Gillenormand has no use for him.

15. “cathedral of Rheims … Chanteloup”: The majestic Gothic cathedral of Rheims was the traditional site of the coronation of French kings; Chanteloup was the legendary château of the duc de Choiseul, prime minister of Louis XV and the epitome of the grand seigneur of the eighteenth century. The château has been razed, but the forty-four-metre-tall pagoda, an example of the decorative folies that decorated great French gardens at the time, still stands.

16. “Argyraspides”: an elite corps of the army of Alexander the Great. Monsieur Gillenormand seems to reach for half-remembered allusions to the classical era to regret the banality of his grandson’s generation.

17. “prince Aldobrandini”: The Aldobrandini were one of the great noble families of Italy.

18. Triton … old, too: “Tritton troittait devant, et tirait de sa conque / Des sons si ravissants qu’il ravissants quiconque.”

19. Euchologion … Aves: The Euchologion is a prayer book usually associated with the Eastern Orthodox Church. “Aves” are recitations of the “Ave Maria,” the “Hail Mary.”

Almost all couples, in the early nineteenth century, complemented the civil ceremony with a religious one.

5. A Mardi Gras … brats: “Mariage un Mardi Gras, / N’aura point d’enfants ingrats.”

6. the church of Saint-Paul: In the rue Saint-Antoine, very near the Hugos’ house in the place des Vosges, the church of Saint-Paul is where Léopoldine Hugo was married in 1843, only months before her death.

7. “the masks”: i.e., those taking part in the celebrations of carnival, when masks and full costumes were traditional.

8. Paillasse, Pantaloon, and Gilles: clowns and fools of vaudeville and other popular theatrical traditions, and typical costumes of carnival.

9. Paris had disguised itself as Venice: The carnival celebrations of Venice were the most celebrated of Europe.

10. Fat Ox: one of the traditional images of carnival and Mardi Gras parades.

11. Lord Seymour: The very wealthy Edward Seymour (1805–85), the future duke of Somerset, spent a considerable amount of time in Paris, where he had a reputation for extravagant spending and low company.

13. Pierrots … Pierrettes: Pierrot the clown or fool and Pierrette are stock characters in popular theatre.

14. mid-Lent carnival: mid-Lent, or Laetare Sunday, the fourth Sunday of Lent, to give people a respite from the restrictions of the season.

15. maenads: a sect of women who worshipped Dionysus, working themselves into an ecstatic frenzy as part of their ritual.

16. Greece needed … Vadé’s fiacre: Thespis is traditionally the father of acting in classical theatre; the popular songwriter Joseph Vadé (1719–57) wrote songs in the coarse language of the working-class poissardes, the market women of Les Halles.

17. Collé, Panard, and Piron: three eighteenth-century playwrights of vaudeville and the popular theatre.

18. Roquelaure … Paillasse: The duc de Roquelaure (1617–83) became a favourite of Louis XIV because of his wit. Paillasse was a clown who took his name from the Italian word for clown, pagliaccio.

19. “Paris is Pantin”: i.e., carnival is the season of reversal, so Paris is disguised as the working-class suburb of Pantin.

20. “the Cadran Bleu … La Rapée”: famous restaurants of Restoration Paris.

### 5.6.2: Jean Valjean Still Has His Arm in a Sling
1. a crown of orange blossoms: the traditional headdress of French brides; see here.

2. the days of Barras: i.e., the Directory, for Paul de Barras (1755–1829) was one of the leading political figures of the era.

3. “Estelle … Némorin”: Estelle et Némorin, an eighteenth-century novel, later the subject of an opera by Berlioz.

4. “the Sancy”: one of the crown jewels of France, originally purchased by Harlay de Sancy from the king of Portugal in 1580.

5. “cholera morbus”: Monsieur Gillenormand would likely be horrified to know that this disease is now known by the even more inelegant name of gastroenteritis.

6. “Célimène … Alceste”: from Molière’s Misanthrope, Célimène is the self-centred coquette who breaks the heart of the inflexible Alceste.

7. “Methuselah”: In the Old Testament, Methuselah lives to the age of 967.

8. “Daphnis and Chloë … Philemon and Baucis”: from classical literature, the two couples represent young love and a love that has lasted into old age.

### 5.6.4: Immortale Jecur
1. Immortale jecur: “the indestructable liver,” a reference to the myth of Prometheus, who was condemned to have a vulture tear at his liver for eternity. To the ancient Greeks, the liver was the physical site of feelings and emotions, so the modern parallel is one of a constantly broken heart.

2. Jacob wrestled with the angel: Jacob wrestled all night with an angel while returning to Canaan with his family (Genesis 32).

3. asks the sphinx: The Sphinx, in Greek myth, would kill and eat anyone who could not answer her riddle. Oedipus finally answered, and the monster killed herself.

4. Brutus … Cato: two of the Roman senators who resisted Julius Caesar. Cato decided to kill himself rather than surrender, Brutus to assassinate Caesar.

## Book 7: The Last Drop in the Chalice
1. the Chalice: probably from Socrates’ cup of hemlock, the image of the chalice as a symbol of inevitable suffering is proverbial in French.

### 5.7.1: The Seventh Circle and the Eighth Heaven
1. the Seventh Circle: reference to Dante’s Divine Comedy, in which hell (Inferno) is divided into circles and heaven (Paradiso) into concentric spheres.

2. Voyages of Captain Cook … Vancouver’s: Accounts by explorers and travellers were enormously popular in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

### 5.7.2: The Obscurities a Revelation May Contain
1. The Corsican vendetta: The generations-long blood feuds of Corsica held an exotic fascination for French Romantics. Balzac, Mérimée, and Maupassant all used the vendetta in their fiction.

2. The old symbols from Genesis: Hugo seems to be alluding to the “mark and curse of Cain,” Genesis 4, when God condemns Cain, the murderer of his brother, Abel, and the first criminal in human history, to wander the earth bearing the visible mark of God’s judgment.

3. a quid divinum: a “divine thing.”

4. vindicte: from the Latin word vindicta, “vengeance,” the idea that justice should be society’s retribution.

### 5.9.4: Bottle of Ink That Only Manages to Whiten
1. too big for Pitt … Castelcicala: William Pitt the Younger (1759–1806), the English statesman and prime minister (1783–1801, 1804–06); and the ambassador of the Neapolitan Bourbons, Fabrizio Ruffio, prince of Castelcicala (1767–1832).

2. la princesse Bagration’s … the vicomte Dambray: two notables of the Parisian grand monde. The princess Bagration was the widow of a rich Russian general who established herself in Paris in the 1820s. The vicomte Dambray, a son of the minister of justice of Louis XVIII, refused to recognize the July government. Thénardier assumes that Baron Pontmercy would be flattered by his assumptions.

3. a slave trader: As evidenced by the repeated references to John Brown, Hugo had become a committed opponent of slavery in the 1850s.

### 5.9.6: The Grass Hides and the Rain Erases
1. He sleeps … is done: “Il dort. Quoique le sort fût pour lui bien étrange, / Il vivait. Il mourut quand il n’eut plus son ange. / La chose simplement d’ellemême arriva, / Comme la nuit se fait lorsque le jour s’en va.”
