### 1.1.12: The Solitude of Monseigneur Bienvenu

#### Saint Francis de Sales
Donougher: Canonized in 1665 and proclaimed Doctor of the Church in 1877, Francis of Sales (1567–1622), bishop of Geneva at Annecy, was revered for his eloquent preaching, his goodness and his love for the poor.

Madden: As Roman Catholic bishop of Geneva, Sales (1567–1622) sought to convert Protestants back to the Catholic faith.

#### Every profession has its cadets
Madden: i.e., its subalterns.

#### Every metropolis has its general staff
Madden: in the Roman Catholic Church, an archbishop’s diocese.

#### a foot in the door for a subdeacon
Madden: Such clerical “livings” were much sought after by young clerics, although many of the abuses of clerical livings were weeded out by Revolutionary and Napoleonic reforms.

#### more abbés than priests
Madden: i.e., leaning more toward politics and the secular life than spiritual and pastoral duties; again, such cases were far more common under the ancien régime than in the nineteenth century. Ambition was certainly present in the French Church in Hugo’s time, but it tended to aim toward bishoprics and cardinal’s hats rather than the diplomatic posts and ministerial portfolios of earlier ages.

Donougher: no footnote, but her translation "they are more holders of church livings than priests, more ecclesiastical dignitaries than bishops" is helpful.

#### conclavist
Madden: i.e., a member of the College of Cardinals, which meets in a papal conclave to elect a new pope.

#### the Rota
Donougher: The Rota is the highest ecclesiastical court of the Roman Catholic Church.

Madden: one of the highest of the canonical courts in the Church.

#### a pallium
Donougher: The pallium is a liturgical vestment worn by the pope and by archbishops.

Madden: a scarf-like ecclesiastical garment worn by certain prelates, usually archbishops.

#### Perrette with her pot of milk
Donougher: Perrette with her pot of milk: A reference to La Fontaine’s ‘La Laitière et le pot au lait’ (The Milkmaid and the Pot of Milk), fable 10, bk 7. Thinking to buy a hundred eggs with the money she makes from selling the milk she is carrying to market, Perrette starts counting her chickens before they are hatched. She then drops the milk on her way there.

Madden: an allusion to a fable of La Fontaine: Perrette, a careless farmer’s wife, dreaming of everything she will buy with the proceeds from the sale of her milk, trips and spills the milk pail balanced on her head.

#### Juvenal and Tacitus
Madden: Juvenal’s *Satires*, along with the *Annals* of Tacitus, were part of Hugo’s rigorous classical education. The two authors are frequent points of reference in *Les Misérables*.

#### Moses … Napoléon:
Madden: It was typical of the French Romantics to include Napoléon among the historic geniuses who changed the world.

#### a sham Corneille write *Tiridate*
Donougher: The French dramatist Jean Galbert de Campistron (1656–1723), whose play *Tiridate*, about the incestuous passion of Tiridates, son of the king of Parthia, for his sister Erinice, was performed in 1691.

Madden: Jean-Gilbert de Campistron (1656–1723), whose *Tiridate* debuted at the Théâtre Français in 1691. Hugo was a great admirer of Corneille, whose work he vastly preferred to that of his contemporary Racine.

#### military Prudhomme
Donougher: _a military Prudhomme_: Monsieur Prudhomme was the creation of the caricaturist, playwright and actor Henri Monnier (1799–1877). Embodying the archetypal petit-bourgeois, full of pompous and sententious inanity, Prudhomme first appeared in 1830 in _Scènes populaires_; in 1852 came the five-act comedy _Grandeur et Décadence de Monsieur Joseph Prudhomme_, then in 1857 _Les Mémoires de Joseph Prudhomme_.

Madden: an allusion to Wellington. Prudhomme and *prudhommerie* came to refer to banal mediocrity in nineteenth-century France, following the writer and illustrator Henri Monnier’s hugely successful caricature of the 1830s. Monnier’s Monsieur Prudhomme was well intentioned but also pretentious, vain, and ignorant. Hugo refers to *prudhommerie* frequently in *Les Misérables*.

#### Sambre-et-Meuse army
Madden: During the Revolution, armies were given the names of the new *départements* to replace the old system of aristocratic and provincial names.

#### Mousqueton
Donougher: Literally, ‘blunderbuss’, Mousqueton is the name of Porthos’s manservant in Alexandre Dumas’s _The Three Musketeers_ (1844).
Madden: Mousqueton was the valet of Porthos in *The Three Musketeers.*

#### Claudius’ bull neck:
Donougher: Suetonius in _The Lives of the Twelve Caesars_ describes Claudius as having a majestic appearance and a bull neck (‘Claudius’, ch. 45).

Madden: Hugo held the successors of Caesar Augustus, including Claudius (10 B.C.E.–54), in low esteem, as the reader will see throughout *Les Misérables*.
