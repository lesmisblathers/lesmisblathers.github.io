## Book 1: A Just Man

### 1.1.1: M. Myriel
#### Myriel was bishop of Digne
Madden: Hugo based his bishop on Charles-François-Melchior-Bienvenu de Miollis (1753–1838), bishop of Digne from 1805 to 1831. Like his fictional counterpart, Miollis was known for the simplicity of his lifestyle and his attention to the poorest members of his diocese. Miollis also welcomed a convict named Pierre Maurin, who had spent five years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread (with aggravating circumstances). Several details of Bishop Myriel’s life are inventions of the novelist and were even criticized by conservative Catholics, who saw Myriel’s lifestyle as a rebuke of the Church, and by the surviving members of Miollis’s family.

The town of Digne was also a fortuitous location for Bishop Myriel’s good works, given that _digne_ means “worthy” in French. The bishop’s name may suggest other meanings. The -iel ending recalls the traditional names of the archangels (Gabriel, Raphael, Michael, Uriel). The name also has a certain assonance with _miel_, “honey.”

#### the parliament at Aix
Donougher: The Provence parliament, dating from 1501 and based in Aix-en-Provence, was the chief judiciary authority and highest court in Provence. Bastions of privilege associated with the _ancien régime_, all the provincial parliaments and the Paris parliament were abolished in the early days of the Revolution.

#### _noblesse de robe_
Donougher: Before the French Revolution the French aristocracy who owed their rank to their military service were known as the _noblesse d’épée_, ‘the nobility of the sword’, while those who were ennobled because of their judicial or administrative position were the _noblesse de robe_, ‘nobility of the robe’, or ‘gown’.

Madden: the hereditary class of magistrates who made up the _parlements_, the law courts of ancien régime France. The robins were considered one rung below the _noblesse d’épée_, the nobility of the sword, the dukes, counts, and so on, of the old feudal-military order.

#### tragic scenes of ’93
Donougher: Louis XVI was executed on 21 January, Marie-Antoinette on 16 October. The Terror implemented by the Revolutionary government’s Committee of Public Safety began in September and continued until the fall of Robespierre in July 1794.

Madden: The year 1793, the fourth year of the French Revolution, saw some of the bloodiest episodes of the era, from the trial and execution of Louis XVI in January to Marie Antoinette’s in October, as well as the beginning of the Terror. Hugo’s last novel, Quatre-vingt-treize (Ninety-three), a story of political conflict in revolutionary Brittany, was published in 1874.

#### even more frightening for émigrés watching them from afar
Madden: Usually taken to refer to aristocrats, the term can refer to anyone who fled France for political reasons during the Revolution.

#### 1804
Madden: In 1804, Consul for Life Napoléon Bonaparte, de facto dictator of France since 1799, became emperor of the French. The coronation of December 2 was officiated by Pope Pius VII in the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris.

#### curé of Brignolles
Madden: The title _curé_, curate, was used to describe almost any priest, as was the courtesy title _abbé_, abbot. Brignolles is a small town in the Provence region. The place names Hugo cites throughout the novel are mostly real, from the Midi to the Paris region later on in the story.

#### the time of the coronation
Donougher: Napoleon’s coronation as emperor took place on 2 December 1804 at the church of Notre-Dame in Paris, in a ceremony at which Pope Pius VII officiated.

#### Cardinal Fesch
Donougher: Joseph Fesch (1763–1839), an uncle of Napoleon, was named archbishop of Lyon in 1802 and created cardinal in 1803; Napoleon appointed him ambassador to Rome that same year.

Madden: Joseph Fesch (1763–1839), Napoléon’s uncle—his mother’s younger half brother—was named archbishop of Lyon and ambassador to the Vatican by his nephew.

#### *palabres*
Donougher: Now commonly used in modern French to mean ‘interminable discussions’, etymologically and historically the word derives from the Spanish _palabra_ (‘word’), which entered French usage as a result of contacts with Africans who had previously traded with the Spanish. The word came to be associated with notoriously lengthy ritual gift-presentation ceremonies. Hence its southern connotations.

#### the Midi
Madden: the south of France.

#### Monseigneur
Donougher: As a simple parish priest Monsieur Myriel would have been addressed as _monsieur le curé_; as bishop he is now _Monseigneur_.

Madden: literally, “my lord,” the formal title used to address bishops; the humble Myriel, unlike his housekeeper, prefers the less pompous _Monsieur_.

#### imperial decree, which ranked bishops … field marshals
Madden: Napoléon was highly conscious of issues of rank and protocol and in arranging the etiquette of his new imperial court.

### 1.1.2: M. Myriel Becomes M. Welcome

#### Monseigneur Henri Puget
Madden: Bishop of Digne (1708–28) and abbot of Simore. Under the ancien régime, bishops often held one or (usually) more abbeys, which supplemented their incomes.

#### Charles Brûlart de Genlis, archbishop prince of Embrun … lord bishop of Senez
Madden: In the early Middle Ages, Embrun was a free city ruled by the archbishop, who was recognized as a prince. The title was used as a courtesy after Embrun officially became subject to the French Crown in the sixteenth century. Under the ancien régime, several bishoprics carried with them secular titles and offices—such as lord bishops and bishop barons, described below—and even political authority. As was increasingly the case in the eighteenth century, the archbishop of Genlis was from an aristocratic family; Crillon and Sabran in particular were great names of the French nobility; Antoine de Mesgrigny, Capuchin bishop of Grasse, was both a Capuchin monk and a priest, a status more common in the Middle Ages than in later eras. Philippe de Vendôme, grand prior of France, descended from César de Vendôme, an acknowledged bastard of King Henri IV and Gabrielle d’Estrées. Philippe (1655–1727), in spite of his clerical status, had a prominent military career, being named grand prior of the Knights of Malta before succeeding his elder brother as the fourth and last Duc de Vendôme. The abbey of Saint-Honoré de Lérins was one of many that provided an income to the princely warrior-monk.

#### Manosque and Sisteron
Madden: two cities in the Provence region of France, within Bishop Myriel’s diocese.

####  the allowance the *département* owes him
Donougher: The division of post-Revolutionary France into newly created administrative areas called départements came into effect in 1790.

#### imperial senator
Madden: Napoléon created the Senate in imitation of Rome, in order to give the gloss of a constitutional order to his government and as a means to honour high-ranking or prestigious citizens. Senators were provided with substantial endowments, often including country houses or châteaux, such as the “magnificent senatorial seat” mentioned here. The senator in question received his *sénatorerie* in return for supporting Bonaparte’s seizure of power in the coup d’état of the Eighteenth Brumaire of November 9, 1799—18 brumaire, year VII, according to the Revolutionary calendar still in effect—that brought Bonaparte to power. The Consulate (with Bonaparte as first consul and then consul for life) replaced the Directoire.

#### Council of Five Hundred
Madden: Under the Directoire government that followed the fall of Robespierre and the Convention, the Council of the Five Hundred was the lower and larger of the two legislative bodies, paired with the Conseil des Anciens, or Council of Elders.

#### Monsieur Bigot de Préameneu
Madden: Félix Bigot de Préameneu (1747–1825), Napoléon’s *ministre des cultes*, or minister of public worship, also one of the authors of the Napoleonic Code.

#### Council of Five Hundred … 18th Brumaire … Bigot de Préameneu
Donougher: On 9 November 1799, 18th Brumaire in the French Republican calendar, Napoleon took part in a coup against the Directory, the French Revolutionary government from November 1795 to November 1799, that led to the introduction of a new constitution under which he became first consul, invested with the powers he needed eventually to become emperor. A rump session of the Council of Five Hundred, the lower house of the bicameral legislature, the Legislative Corps, that formed part of Directory, signed the transfer of political power. Félix-Julien-Jean Bigot de Préameneu (1747–1825), a moderate during the Revolution (and saved from the guillotine by the fall of Robespierre), was a supporter of the Brumaire conspiracy, a member of the committee that prepared Napoleon’s Civil Code, and minister of public worship 1808–14. This ministry was created in 1804 to implement the 1801 Concordat with Rome, and had jurisdiction over all religious affairs in France.

#### the Durance at Château-Arnoux
Madden: The Durance River flows down through the Alps to the Rhone, crossing much of Bishop Myriel’s diocese, including the city of Château-Arnoux.

#### Things were not good with Rome at that point
Madden: After Napoléon had restored the Catholic Church to its official place in French society by the Concordat of 1801 and Pius VII had officiated at Napoléon’s coronation of December 1, 1804, the relationship between Paris and Rome steadily deteriorated [see “The arrest of the pope” footnote]. Caesar is the senator’s flattering reference to the still-new emperor of the French.

#### Bienvenu
Donougher: ‘Bienvenu’ means ‘Welcome’.

### 1.1.3: A Hard Bishopric for a Good Bishop

#### Senez … once an episcopal city
Madden: The town of Senez lost its episcopal status in the reorganization of the French church in 1790.

#### the right to mow their meadows three days before everyone else
Madden: i.e., those widows and orphans would have been allowed to sell their hay at the highest prices possible, without competition from their neighbours.

#### engraved stationery
Madden: Or *papier timbré*, stamped paper, which bore the official government stamp and was required for all legal documents. A metaphor for the expense of lawsuits.

### 1.1.4: Works Corresponding to Words

#### a peerage … grandfather
Madden: Under the Restoration, the Charter, or constitution, provided for a bicameral legislature of elected deputies in the lower house, and a Chamber of Peers, appointed by the king, with a limited number of hereditary seats.

#### Saint Augustine
Madden: Saint Augustine (354–430) was one of the Fathers of the Church.

#### ultra-royalist and an ultra-Voltairean at once
Madden: not so rare a combination, as many aristocrats before and after the Revolution superficially affected the cynical subversiveness of Voltaire while clinging to the ultra-royalist politics that ensured their position and authority.

#### tax on doors and windows
Madden: effectively a luxury tax on home owners, it was, as the bishop implies, a grossly regressive and unfair tax.

#### “Eh bé! moussu, sès sagé?”
Donougher: “Now then, monsieur, are you being sensible?”

Rose's translation: “All right mate, you behavin’?”

#### “Onté anaras passa?”
Donougher: “Where have you been?”

Rose’s translation: “Morning, what gives?”

#### “Puerte un bouen moutu embe un bouen froumage grase.”
Donougher: “I’ve come with a good sheep and a good creamy cheese.”

Rose’s translation: A good sheep gives a good fat cheese.

#### Donougher footnote on the above footnotes
Donougher: The translations given in the footnotes are translations of the French variants that appear in the text of _Les Misères_, an earlier draft of _The Wretched_ (given in Maurice Allen’s annotated edition of _Les Misérables_ published by Gallimard, 1951, in the Bibliothèque de la Pléiade, p. 1991).

#### public prosecutor
Madden: Under the royal governments before and after the Revolution, public prosecutors were extremely powerful, especially in local governments.

#### You may think you are indifferent to the death penalty
Madden: Opposition to the death penalty was a lifelong cause of Hugo, surviving all of his political permutations. His novel *The Last Day of a Condemned Man* (1829), a first-person narrative of a man facing execution, was a powerful and eloquent condemnation of the death penalty.

#### Maistre … Beccaria
Donougher: Joseph de Maistre (1753–1821), an arch-conservative Catholic monarchist who saw the Revolution as divine punishment for the degeneration of society, was the author of a number of works, including _Les Soirées de Saint-Pétersbourg_ (St Petersburg Evenings, 1821), in which he celebrated the executioner as protector of the social order and bulwark against chaos. Cesare Beccaria (1738–94) wrote an influential treatise on the reform of criminal justice entitled _Of Crimes and Punishment_ (1764), in which he advocated the abolition of capital punishment. Hugo himself championed the abolition of the death penalty in his writings, particularly in his 1829 novel _Le Dernier jour d’un condamné_ (Last Day of a Condemned Man) and his short story ‘Claude Gueux’ (1834), and also took part in public campaigns seeking clemency for those condemned – the American John Brown, for instance, in 1859.

Madden: The conservative count Joseph de Maistre (1753–1821) was one of the leading politcal theorists of legitimacy and conservatism in post-Napoleonic France; Marquis Cesare di Beccaria (1738–94) was an Italian philosopher and politician whose treatise *On Crime and Punishment* (1764) advocated penal reform and the abolition of torture and the death penalty.

### 1.1.5: Monseigneur Bienvenu Made His Cassocks Last Too Long

### 1.1.6: Who Guarded His House for Him

### 1.1.7: Cravatte

### 1.1.8: Philosophy After Drinking

### 1.1.9: The Brother As Depicted by the Sister

### 1.1.10: The Bishop in the Presence of an Unknown Light

### 1.1.11: A Restriction

### 1.1.12: The Solitude of Monseigneur Bienvenu

#### Saint Francis de Sales
Donougher: Canonized in 1665 and proclaimed Doctor of the Church in 1877, Francis of Sales (1567–1622), bishop of Geneva at Annecy, was revered for his eloquent preaching, his goodness and his love for the poor.

Madden: As Roman Catholic bishop of Geneva, Sales (1567–1622) sought to convert Protestants back to the Catholic faith.

#### Every profession has its cadets
Madden: i.e., its subalterns.

#### Every metropolis has its general staff
Madden: in the Roman Catholic Church, an archbishop’s diocese.

#### a foot in the door for a subdeacon
Madden: Such clerical “livings” were much sought after by young clerics, although many of the abuses of clerical livings were weeded out by Revolutionary and Napoleonic reforms.

#### more abbés than priests
Madden: i.e., leaning more toward politics and the secular life than spiritual and pastoral duties; again, such cases were far more common under the ancien régime than in the nineteenth century. Ambition was certainly present in the French Church in Hugo’s time, but it tended to aim toward bishoprics and cardinal’s hats rather than the diplomatic posts and ministerial portfolios of earlier ages.

Donougher: no footnote, but her translation "they are more holders of church livings than priests, more ecclesiastical dignitaries than bishops" is helpful.

#### conclavist
Madden: i.e., a member of the College of Cardinals, which meets in a papal conclave to elect a new pope.

#### the Rota
Donougher: The Rota is the highest ecclesiastical court of the Roman Catholic Church.

Madden: one of the highest of the canonical courts in the Church.

#### a pallium
Donougher: The pallium is a liturgical vestment worn by the pope and by archbishops.

Madden: a scarf-like ecclesiastical garment worn by certain prelates, usually archbishops.

#### Perrette with her pot of milk
Donougher: Perrette with her pot of milk: A reference to La Fontaine’s ‘La Laitière et le pot au lait’ (The Milkmaid and the Pot of Milk), fable 10, bk 7. Thinking to buy a hundred eggs with the money she makes from selling the milk she is carrying to market, Perrette starts counting her chickens before they are hatched. She then drops the milk on her way there.

Madden: an allusion to a fable of La Fontaine: Perrette, a careless farmer’s wife, dreaming of everything she will buy with the proceeds from the sale of her milk, trips and spills the milk pail balanced on her head.

#### Juvenal and Tacitus
Madden: Juvenal’s *Satires*, along with the *Annals* of Tacitus, were part of Hugo’s rigorous classical education. The two authors are frequent points of reference in *Les Misérables*.

#### Moses … Napoléon:
Madden: It was typical of the French Romantics to include Napoléon among the historic geniuses who changed the world.

#### a sham Corneille write *Tiridate*
Donougher: The French dramatist Jean Galbert de Campistron (1656–1723), whose play *Tiridate*, about the incestuous passion of Tiridates, son of the king of Parthia, for his sister Erinice, was performed in 1691.

Madden: Jean-Gilbert de Campistron (1656–1723), whose *Tiridate* debuted at the Théâtre Français in 1691. Hugo was a great admirer of Corneille, whose work he vastly preferred to that of his contemporary Racine.

#### military Prudhomme
Donougher: _a military Prudhomme_: Monsieur Prudhomme was the creation of the caricaturist, playwright and actor Henri Monnier (1799–1877). Embodying the archetypal petit-bourgeois, full of pompous and sententious inanity, Prudhomme first appeared in 1830 in _Scènes populaires_; in 1852 came the five-act comedy _Grandeur et Décadence de Monsieur Joseph Prudhomme_, then in 1857 _Les Mémoires de Joseph Prudhomme_.

Madden: an allusion to Wellington. Prudhomme and *prudhommerie* came to refer to banal mediocrity in nineteenth-century France, following the writer and illustrator Henri Monnier’s hugely successful caricature of the 1830s. Monnier’s Monsieur Prudhomme was well intentioned but also pretentious, vain, and ignorant. Hugo refers to *prudhommerie* frequently in *Les Misérables*.

#### Sambre-et-Meuse army
Madden: During the Revolution, armies were given the names of the new *départements* to replace the old system of aristocratic and provincial names.

#### Mousqueton
Donougher: Literally, ‘blunderbuss’, Mousqueton is the name of Porthos’s manservant in Alexandre Dumas’s _The Three Musketeers_ (1844).

Madden: Mousqueton was the valet of Porthos in *The Three Musketeers.*

#### Claudius’ bull neck:
Donougher: Suetonius in _The Lives of the Twelve Caesars_ describes Claudius as having a majestic appearance and a bull neck (‘Claudius’, ch. 45).

Madden: Hugo held the successors of Caesar Augustus, including Claudius (10 B.C.E.–54), in low esteem, as the reader will see throughout *Les Misérables*.

### 1.1.13: What He Believed

#### *Credo in Patrem*
Donougher: ‘I believe in the Father’.

Madden: the opening phrase of the Apostle’s Creed in Latin: “I believe in the Father …”

#### *quia multum amavit*
Donougher: An allusion to Luke 7:47, ‘Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; _for she loved much_.’

Madden: an allusion to Christ’s public forgiveness of Mary Magdelene, from Luke 7:47: “Because she has loved much …”

#### the Brahmans
Madden: in Hinduism, the Brahman spirit is the eternal and transcendent spirit underlying all life.

#### text from Ecclesiastes
Donougher: ‘Who knoweth the spirit of a man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?’ Ecclesiastes 3:21.

Madden: Ecclesiastes 3:19–21.

#### Saint Francis of Assisi
Madden: Saint Francis (1181–1226) is traditionally associated with benevolence toward animals.

#### Marcus Aurelius
Donougher: AD 121–80, emperor of Rome from AD 161: ‘As to the animals which have no reason … do thou, since thou hast reason, and they have none, make use of them with a generous and liberal spirit’, _The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius_, VI, 23, translated by George Long, 1862.

Madden: The Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (121–180), author of the *Meditations*, is recognized as a philosopher of the Stoic tradition.

#### Pope Gregory XVI
Donougher: Bartolomeo Alberto Cappellari (1765–1846) was elected Pope Gregory XVI in 1831 on the eve of an uprising of the Papal States against papal authority; the uprising was suppressed. A reactionary who resisted reform and defended papal sovereignty and the principle of papal infallibility, Cappellari, originally a monk, was made a cardinal without having been a bishop.

Madden: Pope from 1831 to 1846, the traditionalist Gregory was so opposed to modernism that he forbade the construction of railways in the Papal States. He took a similarly conservative view of politics, though it should be noted that, like Hugo, he was a vocal opponent of slavery.

### 1.1.14: What He Thought
