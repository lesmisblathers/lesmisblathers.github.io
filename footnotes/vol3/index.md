# Volume 3: Marius
## Book 1: Paris Studied in its Atom
### 3.1.1: Parvulus
#### Donougher: Parvulus
##### parvulus:
Latin for 'small', meaning here 'child'.
##### the gamin:
Before his consecration by Hugo in the character of Gavroche, the Parisian gamin emerges as a social archetype, both celebrated and deplored by writers and illustrators, from 1830 and the July Revolution onwards. (See Jean-Jacques Yvorel, 'De Delacroix à Poulbot, l'image du gamin de Paris', *Revue d'histoire de l'enfance 'irrégulière'*, no. 4 (2002), pp. 39–72, [http://rhei.revues.org/index52.html]
##### Homuncio:
The term *homuncio*, 'a little man', was used by the later Roman comic playwright Terence (c.190–158 BC). Lewis and Short, *A Latin Dictionary*, 1879, also gives references to use of the word by Suetonius and Juvenal, but none by Plautus (c.254–184 BC).

#### Rose/Madden: Parvulus
##### Parvulus:
Latin for child.
##### Homuncio:
little man. Plautus was a Roman playwright of the third century BCE whose comedies are a frequent point of reference in *Les Misérables* (see especially page 487 and see here).

### 3.1.2: Some of His Particular Characteristics
#### Donougher: Some of His Characteristics
##### *ponts des arts*:
The Pont des Arts iron footbridge across the Seine was built in 1802–4, taking its name from the Palais des Arts, as the Louvre was then called, whereas the artistry in the gamin’s ‘bridges’ would be in their construction out of found objects.

#### Rose/Madden: A Few of His Distinguishing Marks
##### dwarf:
In royal and princely courts of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, dwarves were frequently employed as fools or jesters and, according to classical tradition, used their status to point out the foibles of the mighty, as with Shakespeare's fool in *King Lear*. The dwarf-jester Triboulet is the protagonist of Hugo's play *Le Roi s'amuse* (The King Takes His Pleasure), which inspired Verdi's *Rigoletto*.
##### cherub of the gutter:
For French readers, especially in Hugo's time, cherub, *chérubin*, had a double meaning: not only the Cupid-like angel but also the insolent, Puck-like character in Beaumarchais' *Mariage de Figaro*.
##### fiacres:
one-horse hansom cabs that took their name from the place Saint-Fiacre, thought to be the place where the first carriages for hire were found.
##### his fabulous monster:
According to Yves Gohin, this monster is a memory of Hugo's childhood, when he and his brother Eugène would frighten each other with tales of a monster who lived in the well of their house.
##### Talleyrand:
The celebrated diplomat (see here) was as well known for his sharp wit in society as for his unscrupulous survival skills in politics.
> The prince de Talleyrand … Louis serving him as deacon: Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord (1754–1838) was one of the legendary figures of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras; a great aristocrat, a one time bishop, a revolutionary politician, and above all a political survivor, Talleyrand served virtually every government from the Constituent Assembly through the July Monarchy, reaching the peak of his influence as foreign minister of France, first to Napoléon and then, having helped orchestrate the emperor’s downfall, to Louis XVIII. The Congress of Vienna was a triumph for Talleyrand before Napoléon’s return from Elba cost him his standing with the allies. On July 14, 1790, as bishop of Autun and one of the leading members of the Constituent Assembly, Talleyrand had officiated at a mass of celebration dedicated to the Federation of French citizens and their volunteer militias performed on the Champ de Mars. He was assisted in that mass by a priest named Abbé Joseph Louis (1755–1837). Thanks largely to Talleyrand’s protection, the abbé Louis, more interested in economics than theology, had a long career in government, serving as minister of finance under the Restoration and later for Louis-Philippe.

### 3.1.3: He Is Agreeable
#### Donougher: He Is Likable
##### *titi*:
Like the gamin, another familiar term for a Parisian type.
##### Mademoiselle Muche:
The joke may be that Mademoiselle Mars was a brunette, and there is a fly (*mouche*) called a *brune de mars* ('March brown fly'). A somewhat cryptic reference to *Muche* as a slang deformation of *Mars* appears in *Étude sur l'argot français* by Marcel Schwob and Georges Guieysse, Paris, 1889.
##### Adamastor:
The hideously fearsome giant that guards the southern Cape of Africa in the Portuguese epic poem *The Lusiads* (1572) by Luís de Camões (c.1524–80).

#### Rose/Madden: He Is Nice
##### Mademoiselle Mars:
(see here)

> Jeanne-Marguerite Salvetat (1779–1847), known as Mademoiselle Mars, was the leading actress of the Comédie-Française from 1803 on. Mademoiselle Mars was Napoléon’s favourite actress and briefly his mistress. Later in her career, she would play Doña Sol in Hugo’s Hernani (1830). (see here).

> “Hernani”: With tongue in cheek, Hugo mocks the reaction to his own play of 1830, which was enormously controversial for its complete break with the traditions of French theatre (hence, “not even written in French!”). The antithesis was one of Hugo’s favourite literary devices.

##### *De Profundis* to carnival numbers:
i.e., from religious hymns to bawdy ditties. Carnival, culminating in Mardi Gras, was celebrated with much more fervour in the nineteenth century, just as Lent was observed more scrupulously.

##### Rabelais:
see here.

> François Rabelais (1494–1553) was one of the greatest writers of the French Renaissance. His comic novels Pantagruel and Gargantua combine broad humour, frequently scatological and sexual, with the humanistic ideals of the Renaissance.

##### Adamastor:
a monster imagined by the sixteenth-century Portuguese poet Luíz Vaz de Camões as a metaphor for the dangers of seafaring.

### 3.1.4: He May Be of Use
#### Donougher: He Can Be Useful
##### Fouillou:
Jacques Fouillou (1670–1736) was an independent-minded Jansenist theologian, born at La Rochelle, who made his career at the Sorbonne.
##### *Currit rota*:
'The wheel turns.' An allusion to Horace's *Ars Poetica*, lines 21–2: 'Amphora coepit / institui: currente rota cur urceus exit?' ('An amphora starts to be formed: why as the wheel turns is a kitchen jug the result?').

#### Rose/Madden: He Can Be Useful
##### Prudhomme and Fouillou:
not specific people but personifications of two types: Prudhomme, from "prudent man" (see here), the cautious, complacent, and self-satisfied man so typical of the French bourgeoisie of the July Monarchy and the Second Empire, and Fouillou, from the verb *fouiller*, "to search" or "to dig," the resourceful and self-reliant—sometimes slippery—type, like Figaro.

> Prudhomme and *prudhommerie* came to refer to banal mediocrity in nineteenth-century France, following the writer and illustrator Henri Monnier’s hugely successful caricature of the 1830s. Monnier’s Monsieur Prudhomme was well intentioned but also pretentious, vain, and ignorant. Hugo refers to *prudhommerie* frequently in *Les Misérables*.

##### an Ionian or a Boeotian:
The Ionians, in modern-day Turkey, and the Boeotians (i.e., the Thebans) revolted against the Persian Empire in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE.

### 3.1.5: His Frontiers
#### Donougher: His Boundaries
##### ruris amator:
An allusion to the opening lines of Horace’s Epistle 10, addressed to Aristius Fuscus: ‘Urbis amatorem Fuscum salvere iubemus / ruris amatores’ (‘We the country-lovers wish to salute Fuscus the town-lover’). Horace’s full name was Quintus Horatius Flaccus.
##### Grenelle's ghastly wall:
The wall at Grenelle was a place of execution for military and political offenders, where in 1812 General Lahorie, Hugo's mother's lover, met his end, condemned to death for his part in the Malet conspiracy against Napoleon, a failed *coup d'état* staged by General Charles-François de Malet (1754–1812) in October of that year, while Napoleon was in Russia.

#### Rose/Madden: His Frontiers
##### *Urbis amator* ... like Flaccus:
*urbis amator*, one who loves the city; *ruris amator*, one who loves the country. An allusion to the Epistles of Horace, specifically a letter the poet (Quintus Horatius Flaccus) wrote to a friend, Fuscus, in Rome.
##### Glacière, Cunette ... the Pierre-Plate de Châtillon:
 As with the list of suburban villages at the end of the chapter, many of these sites can still be seen on a map of Paris and its outskirts. Of special note is the "hideous Grenelle wall riddled with bullet holes." The *mur de Grenelle*—a since-demolished vestige of the medieval defensive wall—was the site of military executions by firing squad. Besides Hugo's lifelong abhorrence of the death penalty, this was the site and method of execution of General Lahorie, Hugo's godfather and his mother's lover, convicted of plotting against Napoléon in 1812.
##### Ivry, Gentilly ... Gonesse:
Many of these suburbs have since been absorbed into the municipality of Paris itself.

### 3.1.6: A Bit of History
#### Donougher: A Bit of History
##### the swallows of the Pont d'Arcole:
According to legend, the Pont d'Arcole was named not after Napoleon's victory against the Austrians at the Bridge of Arcola in November 1796, but after a young Revolutionary of that name who died on this footbridge, previously called the Passerelle de Grève, during the 1830 Revolution. Over subsequent years the arches beneath the bridge became home to young Parisian vagabonds, referred to as *les hirondelles du Pont d'Arcole*.
##### Barbier:
The chronicler Edmond Barbier (1689–1771) in his *Journal historique et anecdotique du règne de Louis XV* (1847–56, vol. 3) writes of the abduction of children (pp. 124–60) and of bloodbaths (p. 125).

#### Rose/Madden: A Bit of History
##### "the swallows of the pont d'Arcole":
a real group of homeless children who lived under the bridge and foraged through Paris like Fagin's gang in the 1850s.
##### Louis XIV ... naval fleet:
The Sun King wanted a fleet to compete with the trading and exploration of the Spanish, Dutch, and English; his great minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619—83) built it for him.
##### intendants and the parliaments:
the royal administrators and law courts of the various provinces and cities of France.
##### Barbier:
Edmond-Jean-François Barbier (1689--1771), a Parisian lawyer and diarist whose *Journal* bears witness to Parisian life for almost fifty years, from 1718 to 1763.

### 3.1.7: The Gamin Should Have His Place in the Classifications of India
#### Donougher: The Gamin Would Have His Own Place in India’s Caste System
##### Claude Gueux:
In fact the word *gamin* appears in print in earlier texts than Hugo's short story of 1834, not least in Hugo's *Notre-Dame de Paris* (1831, bk II, ch. 5).
##### *Sanson ... Montès ... Lacenaire* ... *Dautun* ... *Papavoine ... Tolleron ... Avril ... Louvel ... Delaporte ... Castaing ... Bories ... Martin ... Lecouffé* ... *Debacker*:
The Sanson family held the office of public executioner from 1688 until 1847. Abbé Montès was chaplain of the Conciergerie prison, attending those condemned to death, including Pierre-François Lacenaire, who was executed for murder and theft in January 1836, together with his accomplice Victor Avril. While in prison Lacenaire wrote songs, poems and his memoirs (published after his death). He was reincarnated as the criminal poet dandy in Marcel Carné's film *Les Enfants du Paradis*. For details of Lacenaire's role model, the notorious murderer Dautun, see note p. 1315. Louis-Auguste Papavoine was executed in March 1825 for the murder of two children. Edmé-Henri-Charles Tolleron, an engraver, was found guilty of taking part in a seditious plot -- orchestrated by agents provocateurs -- against the Bourbon monarchy, and was executed in July 1816. François Delaporte was executed, together with two accomplices, in April 1824 for highway robbery. In *Victor Hugo raconté par un témoin de sa vie*, Hugo is said to have seen both Louvel (the Duc de Berry's assassin) and the bald Delaporte ('an old man') on their way to execution (Louvel, in June 1820). Dr Edme-Samuel Castaing was executed in December 1823 for the murder of two brothers (of the first with the complicity of the second, who paid him handsomely for it). Jean-François-Louis-Clair Bories was one of the four young sergeants of La Rochelle (along with Pommier, Raoulx and Goubin) executed for sedition in September 1822, despite Bories's attempt to exculpate his companions. Jean Martin is the name of a parricide referred to in *Victor Hugo raconté par un témoin de sa vie* as having been executed in 1825. In Hugo's 1829 novel *Le Dernier jour d'un condamné*, written in protest against capital punishment, Jean Martin's name appears on the wall of the narrator's prison with the date 1821. However, the only parricide with a name bearing any resemblance to Jean Martin who died during this period of whom there is any record was thirty-three-year-old Pierre-Martin Godefroy, executed along with his brother in 1820 for the murder of their father in 1815. Lecouffé and his mother were executed in January 1824 for the murder of an old woman carried out by Lecouffé at his mother's instigation. Philippe-François Debacker was executed in June 1829 for the murder of his mistress and her employer.

#### Rose/Madden: The Gamin Would Have His Place in the Caste System of India
##### a little work entitled *Claude Gueux:*
*Claude Gueux* was in fact an 1834 novel by Hugo himself. He had already used the word *gamin* in *Notre-Dame de Paris;* it is quite possible he forgot in the thirty-year interval between that novel and *Les Misérables*.
##### No festival comes near La Grève:
Executions were performed in the place de Grève until 1830.
##### Sanson and the abbé Montès:
The Sanson family were the chief executioners in Paris from 1688 to 1847, the office passing from father to son. The abbé Montès was the chief almoner for the prisons of Paris under the Restoration and the July Monarchy.
##### Lacenaire ... Debacker:
Like the rest of the criminals named in this chapter, Lacenaire was a real person. Pierre François Lacenaire (1803--36) was the well-educated son of a prosperous merchant in Lyon; arrested for two murders---and a third that he had attempted---Lacenaire managed to make himself a celebrity in prison, writing poetry and his memoirs before his execution was carried out. Hugo would have been thirteen when he saw Dautun executed for the  murder of his brother in 1816 (see here).

> Charles Dautun murdered his brother in 1814 and was beheaded for it in 1816.
Papavoine was executed for murdering two children in the Bois de Vincennes. Tolleron was one of those executed in an 1816 plot to blow up the Tuileries Palace. Avril was Lacenaire's friend and accomplice. Louvel assassinated the duc de Berry in 1820 (see here).

> The duc de Berry was the younger son of the comte d’Artois. As the duchesse d’Angoulême, the wife of his elder brother and daughter of Louis XVI, was past childbearing age, the younger prince’s marriage was a matter of state concern. He was married to his distant cousin Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Sicile, daughter of the king of Naples and Sicily. The duc de Berry was assassinated at the Opéra by Louvel in 1820; the fact that his young wife was pregnant was taken by royalists as a sign of divine favour for the Bourbon monarchy.

Delaporte was a highwayman executed in 1824; Castaing (1793--1824) murdered two of his friends in order to inherit their fortunes. Bories was one of four soldiers condemned to death for plotting a republican coup in the plot of the "Sergents de Rochelle." Jean-Martin is a mistaken reference to Paul-Louis Martin, who was beheaded for murdering his father in 1820. Madame Lecouffé pushed her son to murder an old lady so that they could rob her. Castaing, Bories, Martin, Dautun, and Papavoine were mentioned in Hugo's *Last Day of a Condemned Man*. The details of the criminal named Debacker are elusive.

#####  To be left-handed:
According to an old European superstition, the left hand was associated with the devil, the right with God.

### 3.1.8: In Which the Reader Will Find a Charming Saying of the Last King
#### Donougher: Concerning a Charming Remark Made by the Last King
##### *Evohe!*:
The Bacchic rallying cry among the followers of Dionysus.

##### *pears on walls ... a pear on that too*:
In 1831 Charles Philipon published in his satirical weekly magazine *La Caricature* drawings that established an identification between Louis-Philippe's physiognomy and a pear, which quickly became a national joke. Pears chalked up on walls all over Paris and the provinces were treated by the government as a seditious emblem.

#### Rose/Madden: In Which You Will Read a Delightful Saying of the King's

##### the boats of washerwomen:
Laundresses worked on rafts anchored on the Seine, to take advantage of the flowing water.

##### Eleusinian lamentations of the Panathenaea:
The Panathenaea was a festival in ancient Athens that included song and poetry contests and, every fourth year, competitive games. The Eleusinians were associated with the cult of Demeter and Persephone. *Evoe* was an invocation to the wine god Bacchus, used in orgies and celebrations.

##### From 1815 to 1830 ... pears on walls:
The turkeys are caricatures of the Bourbons Louis XVIII and Charles X, while Louis-Philippe was mocked for his pear-shaped head.

##### a gold louis ... "The pear's on that, too":
i.e., the royal profile on the twenty-franc coin.

##### curés:
literally curates, but used as a catchall term for priests.

##### rue de l'Université:
one of the main streets of the elegant faubourg Saint-Germain.

##### Tantalus:
see here
> “Tantalus”: In Greek mythology, Tantalus was condemned to stand in a pool of water while suffering from a painful thirst. Whenever he stooped to drink, the water would recede from his reach. The verb “tantalize” comes from this myth.

##### the Pont-Neuf:
the oldest existing bridge in Paris, on the western tip of the Île de la Cité.

### 3.1.9: The Old Soul of Gaul
#### Donougher: The Old Spirit of Gaul
##### Poquelin:
Jean-Baptiste Poquelin (1622–73), better known as Molière.

##### Beaumarchais:
The Paris-born playwright Pierre-Auguste Caron de Beaumarchais (1732--99), a watchmaker like his father, is best known as the author of *The Barber of Seville* (first performed in 1775) and *The Marriage of Figaro* (first performed in 1784).

##### Homer nods, but Voltaire might be said to play the gamin:
An allusion to Horace, *Ars Poetica*, line 358: 'And I also become annoyed whenever the great Homer nods off', referring to Homeric lapses into repetition. For Voltaire, Hugo has invented the verb *gaminer*.

##### Camille Desmoulins:
A childhood friend of Robespierre and political ally of Danton, the journalist and politician Camille Desmoulins (1760--94) was one of the architects of the French Revolution who, like Danton, perished by it.

##### He had, as a small lad, ‘flooded the porticoes’:
An allusion to Racine's *Athalie*, Act I, sc. i, lines 7--8, referring to the crowd that emerges from the temple as 'flooding the porticoes'; the traditional schoolboy joke lies in a literal rather than a metaphorical interpretation of 'flooding'.

##### Championnet ... St Genevieve:
As commander-in-chief of the French 'army of Rome', sent to protect the infant Roman Republic in 1798, General Jean-Étienne Championnet (1762--1800) succeeded not only in defending Rome against the Neapolitan king but also in capturing Naples. To celebrate the achievement he was determined that the miracle of the liquefaction of the blood of Naples's patron saint Januarius should occur. And it did. St Genevieve is the patron saint of Paris. The church of St-Étienne du Mont houses the relics of St Genevieve and the Rue St-Jean de Beauvais is near by. Championnet was born and brought up in the south-east of France.

##### the young Theban:
An allusion to Herakles (Latinized as Hercules), the son of Zeus by a mortal, who as a baby squeezed to death two snakes sent to kill him by Zeus' jealous wife Hera. As an adult seeking to purify himself, Herakles was required to fulfil Twelve Labours, the first of which was the killing of the Nemean lion. He is usually depicted in Greek art wearing the lion's pelt.

##### Bara the drummer-boy:
Joseph Bara (1779--93) became a Republican hero of mythic stature when he was killed by counter-revolutionaries of the Vendée who stole the horses he was leading. There were even plans for the boy to be buried in the Panthéon, and his death was celebrated in a painting by David, now at the Musée Calvet in Avignon.

##### He cries ‘Charge!’ just as the horse in the Scriptures says ‘Vah!’:
A reference to Job 39:25. '"Vah" is a word of exultation ... because every bold preacher ... rejoices in the triumph of victory', St Gregory the Great, *Morals on the Book of Job*, the second part of vol. 3, bk XXXI, p. 477, Oxford, 1850.

#### Rose/Madden: The Old Soul of Gaul
##### Poquelin, son of Les Halles:
Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, known as Molière (see here), was the son of a prosperous upholsterer in the commercial district around Les Halles; he was baptized in the Saint-Eustache church, with the young king Louis XIV as his godfather.

> Molière: Born Jean-Baptiste Poquelin (1622), Molière created comedies and characters—the religious hypocrite Tartuffe, the misanthrope Alceste, Monsieur Jourdain of *The Would-be Gentleman*—who are frequent points of reference for Hugo and his readers. The verse quoted here is from *L’Étourdi* (*The Blunderer*). Molière, Racine, and Corneille are considered to be the three greatest playwrights of the Golden Age under Louis XIV.

##### Beaumarchais:
Pierre-Caron de Beaumarchais (1732--99) was both the creator and alter ego of Figaro, the hero of *The Barber of Seville* and *The Marriage of Figaro*.

##### Camille Desmoulins:
Beginning his career with public harangues in the garden of the Palais-Royal, Desmoulins (1760--94) became one of the most ardent revolutionaries, serving as Danton's secretary in the first republican government in 1792. Desmoulins was appalled by the excesses of the Terror and became a critic of Robespierre, which proved fatal. He was guillotined along with Danton in April 1794.

##### Championnet:
Jean-Étienne Championnet (1762--1800) rose from simple soldier to general in less than ten years. "Flooded the porticoes" of churches is Hugo's insolent—*gaminesque*—allusion to a verse of Racine's *Athalie*, in which the phrase is used, obviously in a quite different sense. As commander of the army that took Naples in 1798, Championnet persuaded the archbishop to celebrate the miracle of Saint Januarius (San Gennaro), in which the prelate holds up a vial of the saint's dried blood and declares that it has turned back to liquid.

##### the Theban boy:
an apparent reference to Hercules, whose mother was the wife of the king of Thebes and who killed the Nemean lion as a youth and wore the skin as a trophy for the rest of his life.

##### the drummer Barra:
Joseph Barra or Bara (1780--93), a legendary martyr of the Republic, was killed by Chouan troops in 1793 after he refused to say "Vive le roi" and instead cried out "Vive la République!" Robespierre quickly adopted the boy's death as a symbol of republican devotion and royalist brutality.

##### the warhorse in the Scriptures:
Job 39:19--22: "Do you give the horse his strength and endow his neck with splendour? ... He laughs at fear."

### 3.1.10: Ecce Paris, Ecce Homo
#### Donougher: Ecce **Paris**, Ecce Homo
##### Ecce *Paris*, Ecce Homo:
’Behold Paris, behold the man’.

##### graeculus:
Literally, ‘little Greek’, a patronizing term used by the Roman master for the Greek slave, especially one who served as tutor.

##### *Aventine Hill ... Asinarium ... Pantheon ... Via Sacra ... Tower of the Winds ... Gemonian Steps*:
One of the seven hills on which ancient Rome was built, the Aventine Hill lay outside the city's original boundary and, like the Faubourg St-Antoine, was incorporated within its walls at a later date. Amid his celebrations of Paris as a rival to Rome, Hugo aims a gibe at the Sorbonne -- an asinarium is a collection of asses. Dating from around 50 [BC]{.small_caps} and designed to serve as a weathervane, sundial and water clock, the Tower of the Winds, also called the Horologion of Andronicus, stands close to the Roman agora in Athens. On the Gemonian Steps, which led past the prison in ancient Rome, the bodies of executed criminals were left exposed before being thrown into the river (see Tacitus, *Annals* 3:14 or *Histories* 3:74).

##### The Parisian majo … un gandin:
Flourishing in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the Spanish *majo* (female *maja*) was a working-class dandy who favoured an exaggeratedly Spanish traditional costume. The French *faraud* is a more fatuous kind of dandy. Matched in Paris by the *faubourien* inhabitant of the working-class *faubourgs*, the *trasteverino* inhabitant of Trastevere, on the far side of the Tiber, had the reputation of embodying the soul of the true Roman. The Turkish *hamal*, bent double under his load, has his equivalent in the beefy market porter of Paris. The Neapolitan scoundrel, the *lazzarone* and the Parisian *pègre* are both members of a similarly low-class fraternity of petty criminals. What is common to the cockney, as understood by the French, and the *gandin* is a kind of Jack-the-lad, cock-of-the-walk, preening self-confidence.

##### *Dumarsais's thieving harridan ... Euripides' herb-seller*:
A repeated taunt in the comedies of the Greek playwright Aristophanes is that the mother of the tragedian Euripides was a herb-seller. For the French grammarian, philosopher and contributor to Diderot and d'Alembert's *Encyclopédie*, César Chesneau, Sieur Dumarsais (1676--1756), life was always a struggle. His father died when he was young and his mother squandered his inheritance, including the library, which had to be sold. Hugo refers to her here as the *poissarde*, a word that came to mean 'fishwife' but has the older meaning of 'thief' (apparently deriving from the word *poisse*, slime left on the hands and clothes of people who handle fish -- see R. Anthony Lodge, *A Sociolinguistic History of Parisian French*, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 163).

##### the discus-thrower Vejanus:
Horace mentions a celebrated gladiator named Vejanus (Epistles, I:1, lines 4--5). A marble copy of the Greek sculptor Naucydes' *Discobolus* entered the Louvre collection, together with the *Borghese Gladiator* (now described as a *Fighting Warrior*) in 1808, after Napoleon bought these antiquities from his brother-in-law Camillo Borghese.

##### Therapontigonus Miles ... Vadeboncoeur:
Therapontigonus Miles is the soldier character in Plautus' comedy *Curculio*. In the eighteenth century French soldiers were required to adopt a *nom de guerre* to distinguish them from others in their company with the same surname. Vadeboncoeur (literally, 'Go willingly') was a common choice.

##### Damasippus:
In Horace's *Satires* II:3, lines 18--26, Damasippus describes his passion for buying old statues, and how having lost his own money he now deals on behalf of others.

##### *Vincennes ... Agora*:
In 1749 Diderot was imprisoned for over three months in the Château de Vincennes, east of Paris, for having caused offence with the publication of his *Lettre sur les aveugles* (Essay on Blindness). The trial of Socrates took place in the people's court in the Agora.

##### Curtillus:
In Horace's *Satires* II:8, lines 52--3, the dinner-party host Nasidienus, presenting a dish of lamprey to his guests, mentions that Curtillus adds sea urchins because they give a better flavour: 'inlutos Curtillus echinos, / ut melius muria quod testa marina remittat.' *Echinus* means either 'hedgehog' or 'sea urchin' (also called the sea hedgehog).

##### trapeze:
The Spanish Colonel Francisco Amóros (1770--1848) is credited with introducing the trapeze into France as part of his military gymnastic training programme. In the mid nineteenth century the acrobat Thévelin performed on a trapeze suspended from a balloon at the Hippodrome, and the trapeze act continued to evolve as part of the circus repertoire. The reference to Plautus' trapeze is possibly a play on the Latin word *trapezita*, 'banker', of which there are many in Plautus' plays, including *Curculio* (The Forgery).

##### The sword-eater ... Poecile Portico:
A reference to Apuleius' *Golden Ass*, bk I, ch. 4: 'Et tamen Athenis proxime et ante Poecilen porticum isto gemino obtutu circulatorem aspexi equestrem spatham praeacutam mucrone infesto devorasse' ('And yet at Athens before the porch called the Poecile, I saw a juggler that swallowed a sharply honed sword, with a very keen edge').

##### Rameau's nephew:
The eponymous character of Diderot's posthumously published work (first appearing in a German translation by Goethe, in 1805) with whom the narrator engages in a dialogue satirizing critics of the Enlightenment.

##### *Curculio*:
Curculio (*curculio*, meaning 'weevil') plays the stock role of the parasitic servant in Plautus' play.

##### Ergasilus ... d'Aigrefeuille ... Cambacérès:
Ergasilus the parasite is a character in Plautus' play *Captivi* (The Captives). The lawyer and statesman Jean-Jacques Régis de Cambacérès (1753--1824), president of the committee that drew up the Napoleonic Civil Code, was famous for his gourmet indulgences, which he shared with his close friend the Marquis Toussaint d'Aigrefeuille (1747--1818), who acted as high priest of his gastronomic epicurism.

##### Rome's four young fops:
These are four love-struck Plautine characters: Alcesimarchus in *Cistellaria* (The Casket), Argyrippus and Diabolus in *Asinaria*, and Phaedromus in *Curculio*.

##### La Courtille:
Located beyond the city walls and therefore exempt from the Parisian tax on wine, La Courtille on the heights of Belleville was where Parisians went to enjoy themselves in its many bars, dance halls and restaurants. Mardi Gras festivities continued there throughout the night and the procession of revellers returning to Paris, known as the *descente de la Courtille*, marked the end of Carnival.

##### Aulus Gellius ... Congrio ... Nodier ... Pulchinello*:
The Roman author of *Noctes Atticae* (Attic Nights), written in the mid second century AD and consisting of notes on a wide range of subjects, Aulus Gellius cites the works of many Greek and Latin writers (he mentions 275 by name), for some of whom little else or nothing has survived. Congrio is the cook in Plautus' *Aulularia* (The Pot of Gold), and Aulus Gellius was a great admirer of Plautus. The writer Charles Nodier (1780--1844), a patron and friend of Hugo, was enamoured of Pulchinello and wrote an enthusiastic article celebrating the character ('Polichinelle', *Paris, ou le Livre des Cent-et-un*, vol. 2, Ladvocat: Paris, 1831).

##### Marton ... Pardalisca:
Marton is the beautiful country girl ravished by Sire Robert in Voltaire's verse narrative *Ce qui plaît aux dames* (What Pleases Women; 1764). Pardalisca is the clever slave-girl in Plautus' *Casina*.

##### Pantolabus ... Nomentanus:
An allusion to two parasitic characters mentioned several times in Horace's *Satires*, Pantolabus as a joker or buffoon (I:2, 8), and Nomentanus as a rake or wastrel (I:1, 2, 8; and as one of the guests at Nasidienus' dinner party, II:8).

##### Hermogenes:
Mentioned as a good singer (*optimus cantor*) in Horace's *Satires* I:3.

##### Thrasius:
An alternative spelling for the Trausius in Horace's Satire on frugality, who is referred to as poor but extravagant, II:2, lines 89--111.

##### Bobèche:
Antoine Mandelard (1791--*c.*1841), better known as Bobèche, was a French theatre clown who enjoyed great popularity and success under the first Empire and the Restoration.

##### *Quis properantem me prehendit pallio?*:
'Who is it that tugs me by the cloak when I'm in a hurry?', line 2 of Plautus' *Epidicus*, said by Thesprio to Epidicus.

##### Désaugier's glassful ... Balatro's huge goblet:
The hugely successful songwriter Marc-Antoine Désaugier (1772--1827) summed up a whole philosophy of life in the refrain of one of his most popular compositions: 'Verse encor / encor, encor, encor, / encor un rouge bord, / Dieu joufflu de la treille! / Verse encor, / encor, encor, encor. / Par toi tout se réveille, / Et sans toi tout est mort' ('Pour another, / and another, and another, / another brimming glass of red, / Chubby-cheeked god of the vine, / Through you everything wakens, / And without you everything is dead'). At Nasidienus' feast (Horace, *Satires* II:8), guests Balatro and his dining companion Vibidius call for larger glasses (lines 34--6) and serve themselves generously (lines 40--1).

##### Père-Lachaise ... Esquiline:
Paris's Père-Lachaise cemetery was opened in 1804 in what was then an outlying district of the city, and only after the remains of La Fontaine, Molière, Abelard and Héloïse were transferred there in 1817 did it become a fashionable burial ground. The eastern slopes of the Esquiline, one of the seven hills of Rome, was at one time a burial place for paupers (see Horace *Satires* I:8, line 10).

##### Trophonius' cave ... Mesmer's tub:
Consulting the ancient Greek oracle of Trophonius was a complicated and unnerving experience (as described by Pausanias in his *Description of Greece*, Boeotia, ch. 39), which involved descending into a dark cave. Unable to deal individually with the numbers who flocked to him, the legendary healer Anton Mesmer (1734--1815) developed the *baquet*, a kind of tub around which the patients sat to receive his therapy, based on his theory of animal magnetism. (The commission set up in 1784 to investigate this therapy was headed by Benjamin Franklin, then American ambassador to Paris.)

##### *Ergaphilas ... Cagliostro*:
Count Alessandro di Cagliostro (1743--95) was a man whose life was shrouded in mystery and occultism, who has been identified as an Italian adventurer named Giuseppe Balsamo, although Cagliostro himself denied this. He was eventually arrested by spies of the Inquisition and sentenced to death for being a freemason, although this sentence was apparently commuted to life imprisonment. He has enjoyed a long and varied afterlife in numerous literary and musical manifestations. Ergaphilas may be the Athenian general Ergophilus, who shared with Cagliostro the experience of escaping the death sentence (Aristotle, *Rhetoric*, 2.3.13: 'For men grow mild when they have exhausted their anger upon another, as happened in the case of Ergophilus. For although the Athenians were more indignant with him than with Callisthenes, they acquitted him because they had condemned Callisthenes the day before.')

##### Comte de St-Germain:
Another eighteenth-century adventurer and self-mythologizer, the Comte de St-Germain impressed, intrigued, even fascinated all those who encountered him, including Horace Walpole, Casanova and Madame de Pompadour.

##### St-Médard ... Umumiye ... Damascus:
The tomb of the saintly Jansenist deacon François de Pâris, buried in St-Médard Cemetery in 1727, became a shrine of devotion and the site of miraculous cures among those who flocked to it, many of whom were seized with strange convulsions, a phenomenon that was first recorded in 1731 and persisted for some fifteen years. The great holy shrine in Damascus is the Ummayad Mosque.

##### Mayeux:
Like Aesop a hunchback critic of humanity, Mayeux is the character of the social outsider speaking for the ordinary citizen, by means of which the political caricaturist Charles Traviès (1804--59) and others satirized the bourgeoisie and the July Monarchy.

##### Canidia ... Mademoiselle Lenormand:
Canidia is a sorceress who appears in three of Horace's texts (*Epodes* 5, 17; *Satires* I:8). Mademoiselle Lenormand (1772--1843) was a renowned fortune-teller, supposedly consulted by Napoleon and the empress Josephine.

##### Dodona:
The site of an ancient oracle located in north-western Greece, where the oracle's responses were inferred from the rustling leaves of an oak tree (symbol of Zeus) or from the sound of the wind in the bronze tripods standing around the sanctuary.

##### Messalina:
The notoriously promiscuous third wife of the Roman emperor Claudius, Messalina has become synonymous with harlotry.

##### Chodruc-Duclos:
A diehard royalist, Chodruc-Duclos (1780--1842), once an exceptionally handsome young man, outraged not to be given the high military office he thought he deserved when the monarchy was restored, became a familiar figure on the streets of Paris; like the Greek philosopher Diogenes, he lived the life of a tramp for years until his death. He was on several occasions arrested and even imprisoned, but charges against him were hard to uphold: he could not be called a vagrant since he owned property in his native Gascony, and he argued that the small amounts of money he solicited were loans rather than the fruits of begging.

##### Plutarch:
In *De Genio Socratis* (section 6), Plutarch reports 'the excellent answer' that Thales gave when asked by his friends on his return from a long absence abroad what was the most remarkable thing he had seen: 'A tyrant in old age.'

##### Sulla and Domitian:
Having defeated his political opponents on the battlefield, Sulla was appointed dictator of Rome in 82 BC; he instituted a reign of terror, after two years abdicated, re-established consular government, then retired. He died in 78 BC. Domitian (51--96) ruled as emperor for fifteen years and is portrayed by Suetonius as a cruel and avaricious tyrant. After he was assassinated in a conspiracy involving those close to him, the Senate condemned his memory to oblivion.

##### *Contra Gracchos Tiberim habemus, Bibere Tiberim, id est seditionem oblivisci*:
'Against the Gracchi we have the Tiber. To drink the Tiber is to forget sedition.' The Gracchi -- Tiberius (163--133 BC) and his younger brother Gaius (154--121 BC) -- were Roman tribunes who, in the context of increasing social unrest among the lower classes of society, attempted to introduce land reform in favour of the poor and met with overwhelming resistance from the Senate. Both Gracchi met with a violent end.

##### callipygian beauty is a Hottentot:
The *Callipygian Venus* is a Roman marble statue dating from the first century BC, which was rediscovered in Rome in the sixteenth century and is now held in the National Archaeological Museum of Naples. The epithet 'callipygian' is from the Greek, meaning 'with beautiful buttocks'. Sara Baartman, who came to England from South Africa in 1810 (and subsequently travelled to Paris where she later died), became known as 'the Hottentot Venus', her physique -- her large buttocks in particular, characteristic of her Khoekhoe origins -- attracting immense curiosity and scientific interest. Her remains were finally returned to South Africa in 2002.

##### hold its nose at Basile:
Possibly a reference to Don Basile in Beaumarchais's *Barber of Seville*, as sanctimonious a hypocrite as Molière's character Tartuffe.

##### Priapus' 'eruption':
An allusion to Horace, *Satires* I:8, at the end of which Priapus releases an explosive and what could be interpreted as a flatulent sound to scare off the witches, who run away laughing.

##### the Bal Mabille ... Polymnia ... Janiculum:
Originally a dancing institution for the pupils of the dancing-master Jacques Mabille (1772--1845), the Bal Mabille as developed by Mabille's sons became a huge pleasure garden, with music provided by large orchestras and dancing that continued into the night, illuminated by gaslight, in what was still countryside (to the west of Paris). Polymnia was the muse of sacred poetry, and the Janiculum Hill on the west bank of the Tiber, outside the walls of Rome, was a place of sacred woods and shrines.

##### the purveyor of frippery:
Clothes dealers exploited young Parisiennes who bought second-hand finery from them on long-term credit (see Philippe Perrot, *Fashioning the Bourgeoisie: A History of Clothing in the Nineteenth Century*, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994).

##### the procuress Staphyla ... the virgin Planesium:
Planesium is the virgin slave-girl in Plautus' *Curculio*; the old woman Staphyla in *Aulularia* is the slave of a miserly master whose daughter is pregnant out of wedlock.

##### The Syrian hostess:
An allusion to *The Copa*, a Latin poem attributed to Virgil, about a Syrian tavern hostess (*copa*) who invites her clients to enjoy the pleasures of her establishment.

##### Mère Saguet:
Immortalized in the title of a posthumously published collection of essays by the poet and novelist Gérard de Nerval (1808--55), the tavern run by Mère Saguet, on the outskirts of the city close to the Moulin de Beurre, was frequented by writers and artists including Hugo himself.

##### Charlet:
The painter and engraver Nicolas-Toussaint Charlet (1792--1845) specialized in Bonapartist themes celebrating the Napoleonic legend.

##### Adonai:
One of the Hebrew names for God in the Old Testament, generally translated 'Lord'.

##### Silenus:
In Greek mythology, Silenus was companion and tutor to the wine god Dionysus. A Falstaff-like character, he is often depicted riding on an ass.

##### Ramponneau:
Jean Ramponneau (1724--1802) was a wine merchant who ran a celebrated tavern, the Tambour Royal; it was phenomenally successful, partly because he undercut his competitors' prices, and partly because of his own personality, particularly after he broke a contract he had made with a theatre manager, which led to his involvement in a lawsuit that became the talk of the town.

##### Sybaris:
Sybaris was a colony founded in southern Italy in the eighth century BC by the Greeks. Its destruction in the late sixth century BC was proverbially blamed on the citizens' overindulgence in the comforts and luxuries their great prosperity had brought them.

##### Pantin:
Parisian argot for 'Paris'.

#### Rose/Madden: Ecce Paris, Ecce Homo
##### Ecce Paris, Ecce Homo:
"Behold Paris, Behold the Man"; an echo of John 19:5: "And Pilate said unto them, Behold the man!"

##### *graeculus* of Rome:
*graeculus* means "little Greek."

##### Paris has its Capitol ... the Panthéon:
Hugo believed that Paris was the heir to Rome, as Rome had been heir to Athens, the centre of the civilized world. His comparison begins at the top of the political and social order, by directly comparing the symbols of the government (the Capitol and the Hôtel de Ville), of religion (the Parthenon and Notre-Dame), etc. The Sorbonne is apparently set apart for satire, as an Asinarium, or donkey shed, the "house of asses." Hugo descends from the highest to the lowest aspects of Parisian society and compares the city to the Rome he knew from his readings of classical texts, especially Plautus, whose comedies provide many of the characters in Hugo's long comparison. Only those citations that have some broader echo in *Les Misérables* or Hugo's life and work are explained here.

##### Rameau's nephew and Curculion the parasite:
In Diderot's novel *Le Neveu de Rameau*, the nephew of the great eighteenth-century composer is presented as a philosophical observer of French society as he survives on the invitations and [sometimes]{#notes_002.html_page1261} reluctant generosity of friends and acquaintances. Curculion the Parasite is a Roman social type from Plautus.

##### Café Anglais:
in the boulevard des Italiens, a centre of fashionable nightlife for most of the nineteenth century.

##### *Quis ... pallio*:
From Plautus' play *Epidicus:* "Who stops me in my path, taking me by the cloak."

##### Mademoiselle Lenormand:
Marie Anne Adelaide Lenormand (1772--1843) was a famous fortune-teller in Paris.

##### séances:
Fascinated by the supernatural (and haunted by the death of his favourite daughter, Léopoldine, in 1843), Hugo participated in séances at Hauteville House in Jersey.

##### puts a grisette on the throne:
a reference to Madame du Barry, who was a [sex worker] before being elevated to the rank of royal mistress.

##### Messalina:
The legendary sexual appetites and adventures of Claudius' empress fascinated Hugo, among others.

##### *Contra ... oblivisci:*
"Against the Gracchi, we have the Tiber. To drink from the Tiber is to forget sedition."

##### Tartuffe's posturing ... Priapus' "hiccups":
Tartuffe, the sanctimonious hypocrite who lusts for his benefactor's wife, was one of Molière's most enduring characters; Priapus, the Greco-Roman god of male fertility, often incarnated male lustiness in popular Roman literature and theatre.

##### David d'Angers, Balzac, and Charlet:
The sculptor David d'Angers, the novelist Honoré de Balzac, and the painter and engraver Nicolas-Toussaint Charlet all used contemporary Paris and Parisians as the subjects of their work. Hugo delivered Balzac's eulogy at the Père-Lachaise cemetery in 1850.

### 3.1.11: To Scoff, to Reign
#### Donougher: Jocularity Reigns
##### Alexander:
Carlyle in his 'Essay on Voltaire' (1829) quotes Alexander the Great as saying, 'O Athenians, what toil do I undergo to please you.'

##### Tennis Court Oath:
On 20 June 1789 the self-declared National Assembly -- which the king refused to recognize, also denying it entry to the place where it had previously met as the Third Estate in France's parliamentary body, the Estates General -- gathered in a nearby tennis court (*jeu de paume*), where its members took a vow that they would continue their meetings, as the National Constituent Assembly, until they had drawn up a new constitution.

##### Its night of the fourth of August:
The National Constituent Assembly interrupted its debate on the constitution so as to address the unrest that was spreading throughout France after the storming of the Bastille on 14 July. At the end of a sitting that went on through the night of 4 August, legislation was passed abolishing all feudal rights and privileges in the interests of equality, legitimacy and fairness.

##### *Washington, Kosciuszko ... Botsaris, Riego, Bem*, *Manin, López, John Brown, Garibaldi*:
Before he was elected first President of the United States, George Washington (1732--99) was appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War (1775--83). Tadeusz Kosciuszko (1746--1817) was leader of the 1794 uprising against Imperial Russia and the Kingdom of Prussia, having previously served as colonel in the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War. Markos Botsaris (1788--1823) was a Souliote leader and hero of the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire. The Spanish general and liberal politician Rafael del Riego (1784--1823) was one of the leaders of the mutiny in the Spanish Civil War of 1820--3 that led to the reinstatement of the 1812 Constitution. General Józef Bem (1794--1850) was a Polish freedom-fighter who took part in uprisings in Poland, Austria and Hungary. The statesman Daniele Manin (1804--57) led the Venetian revolution against the Austrians in 1848--9, and was an early advocate of Italian unity. Antonio López de Santa Anna (1794--1876) fought for the independence of Mexico from Spanish rule, later becoming a presidential dictator. The American abolitionist and folk hero John Brown (1800--59), executed for murder and treason by the state of Virginia, is remembered in 'John Brown's Body', which became a Union marching song during the American Civil War (1861--5). Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807--82) not only fought successfully for the liberation and unification of Italy, but also during exile in South America for the liberation of Uruguay from Argentina.

##### Boston ... Isla de León ... Pest ... Palermo ... Harpers Ferry ... Ancona ... Gli Archi:
The Boston Tea Party was an act of resistance to British rule that was to lead in 1775 to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. A military insurgency on Isla de León (now San Fernando) near Cadiz, in which Riego played so decisive a role, marked the beginning of the Spanish Civil War of 1820--3. The Pest Uprising of 1848 was the start of the ultimately doomed Hungarian Revolution. In one of the most dramatic achievements of the Italian Risorgimento, with a core force of only one thousand men Garibaldi captured Palermo from the Neapolitan Bourbon troops in 1860. He went on to take control of Naples and to hand over his territorial gains in southern Italy to the Piedmontese king Victor Emmanuel II. It was after the attack on the federal armoury and arsenal at Harpers Ferry in 1859, with the intention of arming abolitionists and triggering a slave uprising, that John Brown was tried and executed. Ancona fell to the patriots in September 1860. Gli Archi is a coastal district of Ancona that began to develop outside the walls of the city in the eighteenth century.

##### Canaris ... Quiroga ... Pisacane:
A freedom-fighter during the Greek War of Independence, commanding fire boats that set fire to Turkish warships, Constantinos Canaris (1793/5--1877) rose to become an admiral in the Greek navy and was prime minister of Greece when he died. Colonel Antonio Quiroga (1784--1841) was one of the military leaders of the Spanish Revolution of 1820--23. An Italian socialist revolutionary, Carlo Pisacane (1818--57) was killed leading an abortive insurrection in Campania against the Kingdom of Naples.

##### Byron ... Missolonghi ... Mazet ... Barcelona:
Lord Byron (1788--1824) joined the Greeks' revolutionary struggle against Ottoman rule and died at Missolonghi of a fever. Author of *Observations on Yellow Fever, Made at Cadiz in* 1819, Dr André Mazet (1793--1821) himself died of yellow fever when, as a member of a French medical team, he returned to Spain to provide assistance during a later outbreak of the disease in Barcelona.

##### Mirabeau:
Rejected by his fellow aristocrats as a potential delegate to the Estates General in 1788, Mirabeau (1749--91) with his great oratorial and pamphleteering skills was elected as a commoner to the Third Estate and elected president of the National Assembly three months before he died. Buried in the Panthéon, his remains were removed when it became known he had colluded with the king in a failed attempt to establish a constitutional monarchy.

##### Régnier:
Destined by his family for a career in the Church for which he was by nature ill suited, Mathurin Régnier (1573--1613) was a talented poet of satirical and licentious verse.

##### temple of Theseus ... 'Crédeville's a thief':
In the 1830s two graffiti entered Parisian urban mythology (and French literature, in the texts of numerous writers who, like Hugo, recorded the phenomenon): a huge-nosed caricature identified as Bouginier, and the slogan 'Crédeville voleur', sometimes simply the name 'Crédeville'. Their origins remain obscure, although a number of explanations have been offered. Crédeville, for instance, may have been the name of an escaped convict who left his calling-card, as it were, Pink Panther-like, to taunt the police; or the grieving fiancée of some Crédeville taken before his time may have been communicating in this way with her deceased lover; or some victim of a usurer called Crédeville may have been taking his revenge. Gérard de Nerval writes in *Voyage en Orient* that 'Crédeville voleur' and Bouginier's nose are even to be found scrawled on the Pyramids. Privat d'Anglemont has an anecdotal account of Bouginier's nose being used by the first of two separated parties of travellers to lay a trail between Paris and the Pyramids for those following behind them. (See Pierre Enckell, 'Documents pour servir à l'histoire de Crédeville et de Bouginier', in *Études nervaliennes et romantiques III*, Namur: Presses Universitaires de Namur, 1981.) Possibly one sighting was on the Theseion, now known as the temple of Hephaestus, in Athens, where many philhellenes killed in the Greek War of Independence (1821--30) were buried.

##### Montesquieu:
One of the great political philosophers of the Enlightenment, Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu (1689--1755), was elected to the French Academy in 1728 but remained something of an outsider, his first election to that institution in 1725 having been declared invalid because he was still resident in Bordeaux, where he was president of the criminal division of the local parliament. His two great works are his *Persian Letters* (1721), giving a view of European society through the eyes of two foreigners, and *The Spirit of the Laws* (1748), a study of different types of government and the legal and social institutions on which they rest.

##### Condorcet:
The mathematician, philosopher and political theorist Nicolas de Condorcet (1743--94) was a central figure of the French Enlightenment, who believed in social progress through the power of education and knowledge. He was elected in 1791 to the Legislative Assembly, of which he was briefly president. However, opposed to the death penalty on principle, he voted against the execution of Louis XVI and subsequently defended the Girondists, which led to his own imprisonment. He was found dead in his cell, in circumstances which have never been entirely explained.

##### Arouet:
François-Marie Arouet, who adopted the name Voltaire in 1718.

#### Rose/Madden: Railing, Reigning
##### "To please you, O Athenians!" cried Alexander:
The source of this quote, apparently referring to the Macedonian Alexander's conquest of Athens, is unclear.

##### the Tennis Court Oath:
the celebrated moment of June 20, 1789, when the deputies of the Third Estate declared themselves the representatives of the French nation and vowed that they would not disband until they had established a constitution for France. Within a few days, Louis XVI recognized the former Estates General, with its divisions of the nobility, the clergy, and the common people, as the National Assembly. The ancien régime was legally a thing of the past.

##### night of August 4:
a dramatic session of the National Assembly on August 4, 1789, when the deputies abolished all fiscal and social privileges of the nobility.

##### Washington ... Garibaldi
From George Washington to Giuseppe Garibaldi, who as Hugo wrote was working to unify Italy, these men were heroes of nineteenth-century liberalism: Tadeusz Kościuszko (1746--1817) fought in the American Revolution before returning to his native Poland to lead an unsuccessful revolt against Russian rule; Kościuszko died in exile. Simon Bolívar was the great hero of South American independence from Spain. Markos Botzaris (1788--1823) was a leader of the Greek revolt against Ottoman rule. Rafael del Riego (1784--1823) was a leader of the liberal revolt against the king of Spain in 1822. Manin (1804--57) was a leader of the Risorgimento and early advocate of Italian nationalism. Carlos Antonio López (1796--1867) was the first president of Paraguay. Hugo considered the Abolitionist John Brown a hero and martyr. The persons and places named in these passages relate to the movements for independence and liberalism, often republicanism, in Europe (Greece, Italy, Spain, and Hungary) and across South America in the nineteenth century.

##### Boston in 1779 ... Palermo in 1860:
Just as Boston is the cradle of American liberty, the other cities and sites named represent republican and independence movements across Europe in the nineteenth century. "Pest in 1848" refers to the Hungarian uprising against the Hapsburgs. The island of St. Léon was a stronghold for the liberal Spanish insurgents in 1820. In Palermo in 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi led an uprising against the reactionary Bourbon rulers of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

##### Byron dies at Missolonghi:
Lord Byron travelled to Greece in 1824 to join the fight for independence, but died of a fever and subsequent bleedings before he could join in combat.

##### Mazet dies in Barcelona:
Dr. Mazet was one of a group of French physicians who travelled to Barcelona in 1821 in order to study and help fight an epidemic of yellow fever; Mazet died after contracting the disease himself. Hugo's 1822 poem "Le Dévouement" was inspired by Mazet and the other members of the humanitarian expedition.

##### Mirabeau's feet ... Robespierre:
After a decidedly ambiguous early life, Honoré-Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, became one of the heroes of the Revolution due to his powerful speeches to the National Assembly. Robespierre was doomed when he became tyrant in the name of republicanism.

##### Pascal ... Molière:
In Hugo's view, the poets, writers, and thinkers who sought to enlighten (see here) their readers were the true priests of humanity.

##### Bouginier's nose ... *Crédéville is a thief:*
two popular instances of Parisian graffiti that took on lives of their own as the French travelled through Europe. Legend has it that "*Crédéville voleur*" is in fact written at the top of an Egyptian pyramid.

##### Montesquieu ... Danton:
A chronological list of the writers who over the course of the eighteenth century made it possible for Danton to act on his daring. Montesquieu's (1689--1755) *L'Esprit des lois* (On the Spirit of Laws) is one of the founding documents of the Enlightenment and of modern political science. The mathematician marquis de Condorcet (1749--94), called the last of the *philosophes*, joined the (relatively) moderate Girondin faction in the Convention. Arouet is Voltaire's real name.

##### "Daring!" is a *fiat lux:*
Danton rallied the Convention and the Parisian populace to a war footing in 1792, as German and French royalist troops prepared to cross the Rhine, with a passionate speech calling for courageous daring: "*De l'audace, encore de l'audace et toujours de l'audace!" Fiat lux* refers to the first chapter of Genesis: "Let there be light!"

##### the torch of Prometheus to Cambronne's stunted pipe:
Prometheus brought fire, and thus light (enlightenment), to mortals; in Hugo's view, Cambronne's refusal to surrender ("*Merde!*") was a stand against the governments represented by the armies in the field.

### 3.1.12: The Future Latent in the People
#### Donougher: The Future Latent in the People
##### *‘Fex urbis!’* exclaims Cicero:
'The excrement of the city', an allusion to Cicero's *Letter to Atticus*, I.16.11.

##### 'Mob!' adds Burke:
In his *Reflections on the Revolution in France* the Anglo-Irish politician and political theorist Edmund Burke (1729--97) deplored a Revolutionary government whose authority resided in the mob.

#### Rose/Madden: The Future Latent in the People
##### *Fex urbis*, cries Cicero:
i.e., the dregs of the city.

##### *mob*, adds Burke:
The conservative, traditionalist Edmund Burke supported American independence but was resolutely hostile to the French Revolution.

### 3.1.13: Little Gavroche
#### Donougher: Young Gavroche
##### *Château-d'Eau*:
A cast-iron water-tower fountain built in 1811 by Pierre-Simon Girard on the site of what is now Place de la République, it was moved in 1867 to outside the former meat market, now a cultural centre, at La Villette.

#### Rose/Madden: Petit-Gavroche
##### About eight or nine years:
thus, in 1831 or 1832. The July Revolution has in the interim deposed the Bourbons in favour of a new government and new constitution under Louis-Philippe d'Orléans.

##### the boulevard, the Cirque, the Porte Saint-Martin:
Gavroche, the theatregoer, cab fetcher, and errand runner, haunts the elegant district of theatres like the Porte Saint-Martin and the Cirque around the *grands boulevards* on the right bank.
