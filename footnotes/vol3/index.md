# Volume 3: Marius
## Book 1: Paris Studied in its Atom
### 3.1.1: Parvulus

#### Parvulus:
Madden: Latin for child.

Donougher: Latin for 'small', meaning here 'child'.

#### the gamin:
Donougher: Before his consecration by Hugo in the character of Gavroche, the Parisian gamin emerges as a social archetype, both celebrated and deplored by writers and illustrators, from 1830 and the July Revolution onwards. (See Jean-Jacques Yvorel, 'De Delacroix à Poulbot, l'image du gamin de Paris', *Revue d'histoire de l'enfance 'irrégulière'*, no. 4 (2002), pp. 39–72, [http://rhei.revues.org/index52.html](http://rhei.revues.org/index52.html)

##### Homuncio:
Donougher: The term *homuncio*, 'a little man', was used by the later Roman comic playwright Terence (c.190–158 BC). Lewis and Short, *A Latin Dictionary*, 1879, also gives references to use of the word by Suetonius and Juvenal, but none by Plautus (c.254–184 BC).

Madden: little man. Plautus was a Roman playwright of the third century BCE whose comedies are a frequent point of reference in *Les Misérables* (see especially page 487 and see here).

### 3.1.2: Some of His Particular Characteristics

#### dwarf:
Madden: In royal and princely courts of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, dwarves were frequently employed as fools or jesters and, according to classical tradition, used their status to point out the foibles of the mighty, as with Shakespeare's fool in *King Lear*. The dwarf-jester Triboulet is the protagonist of Hugo's play *Le Roi s'amuse* (The King Takes His Pleasure), which inspired Verdi's *Rigoletto*.

#### cherub of the gutter:
Madden: For French readers, especially in Hugo's time, cherub, *chérubin*, had a double meaning: not only the Cupid-like angel but also the insolent, Puck-like character in Beaumarchais' *Mariage de Figaro*.

#### fiacres:
Madden: one-horse hansom cabs that took their name from the place Saint-Fiacre, thought to be the place where the first carriages for hire were found.

#### *ponts des arts*:
Donougher: The Pont des Arts iron footbridge across the Seine was built in 1802–4, taking its name from the Palais des Arts, as the Louvre was then called, whereas the artistry in the gamin’s ‘bridges’ would be in their construction out of found objects.

#### his fabulous monster:
Madden: According to Yves Gohin, this monster is a memory of Hugo's childhood, when he and his brother Eugène would frighten each other with tales of a monster who lived in the well of their house.

#### Talleyrand:
Madden: The celebrated diplomat (see here) was as well known for his sharp wit in society as for his unscrupulous survival skills in politics.
> The prince de Talleyrand … Louis serving him as deacon: Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord (1754–1838) was one of the legendary figures of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras; a great aristocrat, a one time bishop, a revolutionary politician, and above all a political survivor, Talleyrand served virtually every government from the Constituent Assembly through the July Monarchy, reaching the peak of his influence as foreign minister of France, first to Napoléon and then, having helped orchestrate the emperor’s downfall, to Louis XVIII. The Congress of Vienna was a triumph for Talleyrand before Napoléon’s return from Elba cost him his standing with the allies. On July 14, 1790, as bishop of Autun and one of the leading members of the Constituent Assembly, Talleyrand had officiated at a mass of celebration dedicated to the Federation of French citizens and their volunteer militias performed on the Champ de Mars. He was assisted in that mass by a priest named Abbé Joseph Louis (1755–1837). Thanks largely to Talleyrand’s protection, the abbé Louis, more interested in economics than theology, had a long career in government, serving as minister of finance under the Restoration and later for Louis-Philippe.

### 3.1.3: He Is Agreeable

#### *titi*:
Donougher: Like the gamin, another familiar term for a Parisian type.

#### Mademoiselle Mars ... Mademoiselle Muche:
Donougher: The joke may be that Mademoiselle Mars was a brunette, and there is a fly (*mouche*) called a *brune de mars* ('March brown fly'). A somewhat cryptic reference to *Muche* as a slang deformation of *Mars* appears in *Étude sur l'argot français* by Marcel Schwob and Georges Guieysse, Paris, 1889.

Madden: (see here)

> Jeanne-Marguerite Salvetat (1779–1847), known as Mademoiselle Mars, was the leading actress of the Comédie-Française from 1803 on. Mademoiselle Mars was Napoléon’s favourite actress and briefly his mistress. Later in her career, she would play Doña Sol in Hugo’s Hernani (1830). (see here).

> “Hernani”: With tongue in cheek, Hugo mocks the reaction to his own play of 1830, which was enormously controversial for its complete break with the traditions of French theatre (hence, “not even written in French!”). The antithesis was one of Hugo’s favourite literary devices.

#### *De Profundis* to carnival numbers:
Madden: i.e., from religious hymns to bawdy ditties. Carnival, culminating in Mardi Gras, was celebrated with much more fervour in the nineteenth century, just as Lent was observed more scrupulously.

#### Rabelais:
Madden: see here.

> François Rabelais (1494–1553) was one of the greatest writers of the French Renaissance. His comic novels Pantagruel and Gargantua combine broad humour, frequently scatological and sexual, with the humanistic ideals of the Renaissance.

#### Adamastor:
Donougher: The hideously fearsome giant that guards the southern Cape of Africa in the Portuguese epic poem *The Lusiads* (1572) by Luís de Camões (c.1524–80).

Madden: a monster imagined by the sixteenth-century Portuguese poet Luíz Vaz de Camões as a metaphor for the dangers of seafaring.


### 3.1.4: He May Be of Use

#### Prudhomme and Fouillou:
Donougher: Jacques Fouillou (1670–1736) was an independent-minded Jansenist theologian, born at La Rochelle, who made his career at the Sorbonne.

Madden: not specific people but personifications of two types: Prudhomme, from "prudent man" (see here), the cautious, complacent, and self-satisfied man so typical of the French bourgeoisie of the July Monarchy and the Second Empire, and Fouillou, from the verb *fouiller*, "to search" or "to dig," the resourceful and self-reliant—sometimes slippery—type, like Figaro.

> Prudhomme and *prudhommerie* came to refer to banal mediocrity in nineteenth-century France, following the writer and illustrator Henri Monnier’s hugely successful caricature of the 1830s. Monnier’s Monsieur Prudhomme was well intentioned but also pretentious, vain, and ignorant. Hugo refers to *prudhommerie* frequently in *Les Misérables*.

#### an Ionian or a Boeotian:
Madden: The Ionians, in modern-day Turkey, and the Boeotians (i.e., the Thebans) revolted against the Persian Empire in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE.

#### *Currit rota*:
Donougher: 'The wheel turns.' An allusion to Horace's *Ars Poetica*, lines 21–2: 'Amphora coepit / institui: currente rota cur urceus exit?' ('An amphora starts to be formed: why as the wheel turns is a kitchen jug the result?').

### 3.1.5: His Frontiers

#### *Urbis amator*, like Fuscus; *ruris amator*, like Flaccus:
Donougher: An allusion to the opening lines of Horace’s Epistle 10, addressed to Aristius Fuscus: ‘Urbis amatorem Fuscum salvere iubemus / ruris amatores’ (‘We the country-lovers wish to salute Fuscus the town-lover’). Horace’s full name was Quintus Horatius Flaccus.

Madden: *urbis amator*, one who loves the city; *ruris amator*, one who loves the country. An allusion to the Epistles of Horace, specifically a letter the poet (Quintus Horatius Flaccus) wrote to a friend, Fuscus, in Rome.

#### Glacière, Cunette ... hideous Grenelle wall ... the Pierre-Plate de Châtillon:
Donougher: The wall at Grenelle was a place of execution for military and political offenders, where in 1812 General Lahorie, Hugo's mother's lover, met his end, condemned to death for his part in the Malet conspiracy against Napoleon, a failed *coup d'état* staged by General Charles-François de Malet (1754–1812) in October of that year, while Napoleon was in Russia.

Madden: As with the list of suburban villages at the end of the chapter, many of these sites can still be seen on a map of Paris and its outskirts. Of special note is the "hideous Grenelle wall riddled with bullet holes." The *mur de Grenelle*—a since-demolished vestige of the medieval defensive wall—was the site of military executions by firing squad. Besides Hugo's lifelong abhorrence of the death penalty, this was the site and method of execution of General Lahorie, Hugo's godfather and his mother's lover, convicted of plotting against Napoléon in 1812.

#### Ivry, Gentilly ... Gonesse:
Madden: Many of these suburbs have since been absorbed into the municipality of Paris itself.

### 3.1.6: A Bit of History

#### the swallows of the Pont d'Arcole:
Donougher: According to legend, the Pont d'Arcole was named not after Napoleon's victory against the Austrians at the Bridge of Arcola in November 1796, but after a young Revolutionary of that name who died on this footbridge, previously called the Passerelle de Grève, during the 1830 Revolution. Over subsequent years the arches beneath the bridge became home to young Parisian vagabonds, referred to as *les hirondelles du Pont d'Arcole*.

Madden: a real group of homeless children who lived under the bridge and foraged through Paris like Fagin's gang in the 1850s.

#### Louis XIV ... naval fleet:
Madden: The Sun King wanted a fleet to compete with the trading and exploration of the Spanish, Dutch, and English; his great minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619—83) built it for him.

#### intendants and the parliaments:
Madden: the royal administrators and law courts of the various provinces and cities of France.

#### Barbier:
Donougher: The chronicler Edmond Barbier (1689–1771) in his *Journal historique et anecdotique du règne de Louis XV* (1847–56, vol. 3) writes of the abduction of children (pp. 124–60) and of bloodbaths (p. 125).

Madden: Edmond-Jean-François Barbier (1689--1771), a Parisian lawyer and diarist whose *Journal* bears witness to Parisian life for almost fifty years, from 1718 to 1763.

### 3.1.7: The Gamin Should Have His Place in the Classifications of India

#### Claude Gueux:
Donougher: In fact the word *gamin* appears in print in earlier texts than Hugo's short story of 1834, not least in Hugo's *Notre-Dame de Paris* (1831, bk II, ch. 5).

Madden: *Claude Gueux* was in fact an 1834 novel by Hugo himself. He had already used the word *gamin* in *Notre-Dame de Paris;* it is quite possible he forgot in the thirty-year interval between that novel and *Les Misérables*.

#### No festival comes near La Grève:
Madden: Executions were performed in the place de Grève until 1830.

#### *Sanson ... Montès ... Lacenaire* ... *Dautun* ... *Papavoine ... Tolleron ... Avril ... Louvel ... Delaporte ... Castaing ... Bories ... Martin ... Lecouffé* ... *Debacker*:
Donougher: The Sanson family held the office of public executioner from 1688 until 1847. Abbé Montès was chaplain of the Conciergerie prison, attending those condemned to death, including Pierre-François Lacenaire, who was executed for murder and theft in January 1836, together with his accomplice Victor Avril. While in prison Lacenaire wrote songs, poems and his memoirs (published after his death). He was reincarnated as the criminal poet dandy in Marcel Carné's film *Les Enfants du Paradis*. For details of Lacenaire's role model, the notorious murderer Dautun, see note p. 1315. Louis-Auguste Papavoine was executed in March 1825 for the murder of two children. Edmé-Henri-Charles Tolleron, an engraver, was found guilty of taking part in a seditious plot -- orchestrated by agents provocateurs -- against the Bourbon monarchy, and was executed in July 1816. François Delaporte was executed, together with two accomplices, in April 1824 for highway robbery. In *Victor Hugo raconté par un témoin de sa vie*, Hugo is said to have seen both Louvel (the Duc de Berry's assassin) and the bald Delaporte ('an old man') on their way to execution (Louvel, in June 1820). Dr Edme-Samuel Castaing was executed in December 1823 for the murder of two brothers (of the first with the complicity of the second, who paid him handsomely for it). Jean-François-Louis-Clair Bories was one of the four young sergeants of La Rochelle (along with Pommier, Raoulx and Goubin) executed for sedition in September 1822, despite Bories's attempt to exculpate his companions. Jean Martin is the name of a parricide referred to in *Victor Hugo raconté par un témoin de sa vie* as having been executed in 1825. In Hugo's 1829 novel *Le Dernier jour d'un condamné*, written in protest against capital punishment, Jean Martin's name appears on the wall of the narrator's prison with the date 1821. However, the only parricide with a name bearing any resemblance to Jean Martin who died during this period of whom there is any record was thirty-three-year-old Pierre-Martin Godefroy, executed along with his brother in 1820 for the murder of their father in 1815. Lecouffé and his mother were executed in January 1824 for the murder of an old woman carried out by Lecouffé at his mother's instigation. Philippe-François Debacker was executed in June 1829 for the murder of his mistress and her employer.

Madden: The Sanson family were the chief executioners in Paris from 1688 to 1847, the office passing from father to son. The abbé Montès was the chief almoner for the prisons of Paris under the Restoration and the July Monarchy.

Like the rest of the criminals named in this chapter, Lacenaire was a real person. Pierre François Lacenaire (1803--36) was the well-educated son of a prosperous merchant in Lyon; arrested for two murders---and a third that he had attempted---Lacenaire managed to make himself a celebrity in prison, writing poetry and his memoirs before his execution was carried out. Hugo would have been thirteen when he saw Dautun executed for the  murder of his brother in 1816 (see here).

> Charles Dautun murdered his brother in 1814 and was beheaded for it in 1816.
Papavoine was executed for murdering two children in the Bois de Vincennes. Tolleron was one of those executed in an 1816 plot to blow up the Tuileries Palace. Avril was Lacenaire's friend and accomplice. Louvel assassinated the duc de Berry in 1820 (see here).

> The duc de Berry was the younger son of the comte d’Artois. As the duchesse d’Angoulême, the wife of his elder brother and daughter of Louis XVI, was past childbearing age, the younger prince’s marriage was a matter of state concern. He was married to his distant cousin Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Sicile, daughter of the king of Naples and Sicily. The duc de Berry was assassinated at the Opéra by Louvel in 1820; the fact that his young wife was pregnant was taken by royalists as a sign of divine favour for the Bourbon monarchy.

Delaporte was a highwayman executed in 1824; Castaing (1793--1824) murdered two of his friends in order to inherit their fortunes. Bories was one of four soldiers condemned to death for plotting a republican coup in the plot of the "Sergents de Rochelle." Jean-Martin is a mistaken reference to Paul-Louis Martin, who was beheaded for murdering his father in 1820. Madame Lecouffé pushed her son to murder an old lady so that they could rob her. Castaing, Bories, Martin, Dautun, and Papavoine were mentioned in Hugo's *Last Day of a Condemned Man*. The details of the criminal named Debacker are elusive.

####  To be left-handed:
Madden: According to an old European superstition, the left hand was associated with the devil, the right with God.

### 3.1.8: In Which the Reader Will Find a Charming Saying of the Last King

#### the boats of washerwomen:
Madden: Laundresses worked on rafts anchored on the Seine, to take advantage of the flowing water.

##### Eleusinian lamentations of the Panathenaea:
Madden: The Panathenaea was a festival in ancient Athens that included song and poetry contests and, every fourth year, competitive games. The Eleusinians were associated with the cult of Demeter and Persephone.

#### *Evohe!*:
Donougher: The Bacchic rallying cry among the followers of Dionysus.

Madden: *Evoe* was an invocation to the wine god Bacchus, used in orgies and celebrations.

#### From 1815 to 1830, he imitated the call of the turkey; from 1830 to 1848, he scrawled pears on walls:
Madden: The turkeys are caricatures of the Bourbons Louis XVIII and Charles X, while Louis-Philippe was mocked for his pear-shaped head.

Donougher: In 1831 Charles Philipon published in his satirical weekly magazine *La Caricature* drawings that established an identification between Louis-Philippe's physiognomy and a pear, which quickly became a national joke. Pears chalked up on walls all over Paris and the provinces were treated by the government as a seditious emblem.

#### a gold louis ... "The pear's on that, too":
Madden: i.e., the royal profile on the twenty-franc coin.

#### curés:
Madden: literally curates, but used as a catchall term for priests.

#### rue de l'Université:
Madden: one of the main streets of the elegant faubourg Saint-Germain.

#### Tantalus:
Madden: see here
> “Tantalus”: In Greek mythology, Tantalus was condemned to stand in a pool of water while suffering from a painful thirst. Whenever he stooped to drink, the water would recede from his reach. The verb “tantalize” comes from this myth.

#### the Pont-Neuf:
Madden: the oldest existing bridge in Paris, on the western tip of the Île de la Cité.

### 3.1.9: The Old Soul of Gaul

#### Poquelin:
Donougher: Jean-Baptiste Poquelin (1622–73), better known as Molière.

Madden: Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, known as Molière (see here), was the son of a prosperous upholsterer in the commercial district around Les Halles; he was baptized in the Saint-Eustache church, with the young king Louis XIV as his godfather.

> Molière: Born Jean-Baptiste Poquelin (1622), Molière created comedies and characters—the religious hypocrite Tartuffe, the misanthrope Alceste, Monsieur Jourdain of *The Would-be Gentleman*—who are frequent points of reference for Hugo and his readers. The verse quoted here is from *L’Étourdi* (*The Blunderer*). Molière, Racine, and Corneille are considered to be the three greatest playwrights of the Golden Age under Louis XIV.

#### Beaumarchais:
Donougher: The Paris-born playwright Pierre-Auguste Caron de Beaumarchais (1732--99), a watchmaker like his father, is best known as the author of *The Barber of Seville* (first performed in 1775) and *The Marriage of Figaro* (first performed in 1784).

Madden: Pierre-Caron de Beaumarchais (1732--99) was both the creator and alter ego of Figaro, the hero of *The Barber of Seville* and *The Marriage of Figaro*.

#### Homer nods, but Voltaire might be said to play the gamin:
Donougher: An allusion to Horace, *Ars Poetica*, line 358: 'And I also become annoyed whenever the great Homer nods off', referring to Homeric lapses into repetition. For Voltaire, Hugo has invented the verb *gaminer*.

#### Camille Desmoulins:
Donougher: A childhood friend of Robespierre and political ally of Danton, the journalist and politician Camille Desmoulins (1760--94) was one of the architects of the French Revolution who, like Danton, perished by it.

Madden: Beginning his career with public harangues in the garden of the Palais-Royal, Desmoulins (1760--94) became one of the most ardent revolutionaries, serving as Danton's secretary in the first republican government in 1792. Desmoulins was appalled by the excesses of the Terror and became a critic of Robespierre, which proved fatal. He was guillotined along with Danton in April 1794.

#### He had, as a small lad, ‘flooded the porticoes’:
Donougher: An allusion to Racine's *Athalie*, Act I, sc. i, lines 7--8, referring to the crowd that emerges from the temple as 'flooding the porticoes'; the traditional schoolboy joke lies in a literal rather than a metaphorical interpretation of 'flooding'.

Madden: "Flooded the porticoes" of churches is Hugo's insolent—*gaminesque*—allusion to a verse of Racine's *Athalie*, in which the phrase is used, obviously in a quite different sense.

#### Championnet ... St Genevieve:
Donougher: As commander-in-chief of the French 'army of Rome', sent to protect the infant Roman Republic in 1798, General Jean-Étienne Championnet (1762--1800) succeeded not only in defending Rome against the Neapolitan king but also in capturing Naples. To celebrate the achievement he was determined that the miracle of the liquefaction of the blood of Naples's patron saint Januarius should occur. And it did. St Genevieve is the patron saint of Paris. The church of St-Étienne du Mont houses the relics of St Genevieve and the Rue St-Jean de Beauvais is near by. Championnet was born and brought up in the south-east of France.

Madden:
Jean-Étienne Championnet (1762--1800) rose from simple soldier to general in less than ten years. As commander of the army that took Naples in 1798, Championnet persuaded the archbishop to celebrate the miracle of Saint Januarius (San Gennaro), in which the prelate holds up a vial of the saint's dried blood and declares that it has turned back to liquid.

#### the young Theban:
Donougher: An allusion to Herakles (Latinized as Hercules), the son of Zeus by a mortal, who as a baby squeezed to death two snakes sent to kill him by Zeus' jealous wife Hera. As an adult seeking to purify himself, Herakles was required to fulfil Twelve Labours, the first of which was the killing of the Nemean lion. He is usually depicted in Greek art wearing the lion's pelt.

Madden: an apparent reference to Hercules, whose mother was the wife of the king of Thebes and who killed the Nemean lion as a youth and wore the skin as a trophy for the rest of his life.

#### Bara the drummer-boy:
Donougher: Joseph Bara (1779--93) became a Republican hero of mythic stature when he was killed by counter-revolutionaries of the Vendée who stole the horses he was leading. There were even plans for the boy to be buried in the Panthéon, and his death was celebrated in a painting by David, now at the Musée Calvet in Avignon.

Madden: Joseph Barra or Bara (1780--93), a legendary martyr of the Republic, was killed by Chouan troops in 1793 after he refused to say "Vive le roi" and instead cried out "Vive la République!" Robespierre quickly adopted the boy's death as a symbol of republican devotion and royalist brutality.

#### He cries ‘Charge!’ just as the horse in the Scriptures says ‘Vah!’:
Donougher: A reference to Job 39:25. '"Vah" is a word of exultation ... because every bold preacher ... rejoices in the triumph of victory', St Gregory the Great, *Morals on the Book of Job*, the second part of vol. 3, bk XXXI, p. 477, Oxford, 1850.

Madden: Job 39:19--22: "Do you give the horse his strength and endow his neck with splendour? ... He laughs at fear."

### 3.1.10: Ecce Paris, Ecce Homo

#### Ecce *Paris*, Ecce Homo:
Donougher: ’Behold Paris, behold the man’.

Madden: "Behold Paris, Behold the Man"; an echo of John 19:5: "And Pilate said unto them, Behold the man!"

#### graeculus:
Donougher: Literally, ‘little Greek’, a patronizing term used by the Roman master for the Greek slave, especially one who served as tutor.

Madden: *graeculus* means "little Greek."


##### *Aventine Hill ... Asinarium ... Pantheon ... Via Sacra ... Tower of the Winds ... Gemonian Steps*:
Donougher: One of the seven hills on which ancient Rome was built, the Aventine Hill lay outside the city's original boundary and, like the Faubourg St-Antoine, was incorporated within its walls at a later date. Amid his celebrations of Paris as a rival to Rome, Hugo aims a gibe at the Sorbonne -- an asinarium is a collection of asses. Dating from around 50 BC and designed to serve as a weathervane, sundial and water clock, the Tower of the Winds, also called the Horologion of Andronicus, stands close to the Roman agora in Athens. On the Gemonian Steps, which led past the prison in ancient Rome, the bodies of executed criminals were left exposed before being thrown into the river (see Tacitus, *Annals* 3:14 or *Histories* 3:74).

Madden: Hugo believed that Paris was the heir to Rome, as Rome had been heir to Athens, the centre of the civilized world. His comparison begins at the top of the political and social order, by directly comparing the symbols of the government (the Capitol and the Hôtel de Ville), of religion (the Parthenon and Notre-Dame), etc. The Sorbonne is apparently set apart for satire, as an Asinarium, or donkey shed, the "house of asses." Hugo descends from the highest to the lowest aspects of Parisian society and compares the city to the Rome he knew from his readings of classical texts, especially Plautus, whose comedies provide many of the characters in Hugo's long comparison. Only those citations that have some broader echo in *Les Misérables* or Hugo's life and work are explained here.

#### The Parisian majo … un gandin:
Donougher: Flourishing in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the Spanish *majo* (female *maja*) was a working-class dandy who favoured an exaggeratedly Spanish traditional costume. The French *faraud* is a more fatuous kind of dandy. Matched in Paris by the *faubourien* inhabitant of the working-class *faubourgs*, the *trasteverino* inhabitant of Trastevere, on the far side of the Tiber, had the reputation of embodying the soul of the true Roman. The Turkish *hamal*, bent double under his load, has his equivalent in the beefy market porter of Paris. The Neapolitan scoundrel, the *lazzarone* and the Parisian *pègre* are both members of a similarly low-class fraternity of petty criminals. What is common to the cockney, as understood by the French, and the *gandin* is a kind of Jack-the-lad, cock-of-the-walk, preening self-confidence.

#### *Dumarsais's thieving harridan ... Euripides' herb-seller*:
Donougher: A repeated taunt in the comedies of the Greek playwright Aristophanes is that the mother of the tragedian Euripides was a herb-seller. For the French grammarian, philosopher and contributor to Diderot and d'Alembert's *Encyclopédie*, César Chesneau, Sieur Dumarsais (1676--1756), life was always a struggle. His father died when he was young and his mother squandered his inheritance, including the library, which had to be sold. Hugo refers to her here as the *poissarde*, a word that came to mean 'fishwife' but has the older meaning of 'thief' (apparently deriving from the word *poisse*, slime left on the hands and clothes of people who handle fish -- see R. Anthony Lodge, *A Sociolinguistic History of Parisian French*, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 163).

#### the discus-thrower Vejanus:
Donougher: Horace mentions a celebrated gladiator named Vejanus (Epistles, I:1, lines 4--5). A marble copy of the Greek sculptor Naucydes' *Discobolus* entered the Louvre collection, together with the *Borghese Gladiator* (now described as a *Fighting Warrior*) in 1808, after Napoleon bought these antiquities from his brother-in-law Camillo Borghese.

#### Therapontigonus Miles ... Vadeboncoeur:
Donougher: Therapontigonus Miles is the soldier character in Plautus' comedy *Curculio*. In the eighteenth century French soldiers were required to adopt a *nom de guerre* to distinguish them from others in their company with the same surname. Vadeboncoeur (literally, 'Go willingly') was a common choice.

#### Damasippus:
Donougher: In Horace's *Satires* II:3, lines 18--26, Damasippus describes his passion for buying old statues, and how having lost his own money he now deals on behalf of others.

#### *Vincennes ... Agora*:
Donougher: In 1749 Diderot was imprisoned for over three months in the Château de Vincennes, east of Paris, for having caused offence with the publication of his *Lettre sur les aveugles* (Essay on Blindness). The trial of Socrates took place in the people's court in the Agora.

#### Curtillus:
Donougher: In Horace's *Satires* II:8, lines 52--3, the dinner-party host Nasidienus, presenting a dish of lamprey to his guests, mentions that Curtillus adds sea urchins because they give a better flavour: 'inlutos Curtillus echinos, / ut melius muria quod testa marina remittat.' *Echinus* means either 'hedgehog' or 'sea urchin' (also called the sea hedgehog).

#### trapeze:
Donougher: The Spanish Colonel Francisco Amóros (1770--1848) is credited with introducing the trapeze into France as part of his military gymnastic training programme. In the mid nineteenth century the acrobat Thévelin performed on a trapeze suspended from a balloon at the Hippodrome, and the trapeze act continued to evolve as part of the circus repertoire. The reference to Plautus' trapeze is possibly a play on the Latin word *trapezita*, 'banker', of which there are many in Plautus' plays, including *Curculio* (The Forgery).

#### The sword-eater ... Poecile Portico:
Donougher: A reference to Apuleius' *Golden Ass*, bk I, ch. 4: 'Et tamen Athenis proxime et ante Poecilen porticum isto gemino obtutu circulatorem aspexi equestrem spatham praeacutam mucrone infesto devorasse' ('And yet at Athens before the porch called the Poecile, I saw a juggler that swallowed a sharply honed sword, with a very keen edge').

#### Rameau's nephew:
Donougher: The eponymous character of Diderot's posthumously published work (first appearing in a German translation by Goethe, in 1805) with whom the narrator engages in a dialogue satirizing critics of the Enlightenment.

Madden: In Diderot's novel *Le Neveu de Rameau*, the nephew of the great eighteenth-century composer is presented as a philosophical observer of French society as he survives on the invitations and sometimes reluctant generosity of friends and acquaintances.

#### *Curculio*:
Donougher: Curculio (*curculio*, meaning 'weevil') plays the stock role of the parasitic servant in Plautus' play.

Madden: Curculion the Parasite is a Roman social type from Plautus.

#### Ergasilus ... d'Aigrefeuille ... Cambacérès:
Donougher: Ergasilus the parasite is a character in Plautus' play *Captivi* (The Captives). The lawyer and statesman Jean-Jacques Régis de Cambacérès (1753--1824), president of the committee that drew up the Napoleonic Civil Code, was famous for his gourmet indulgences, which he shared with his close friend the Marquis Toussaint d'Aigrefeuille (1747--1818), who acted as high priest of his gastronomic epicurism.

#### Rome's four young fops:
Donougher: These are four love-struck Plautine characters: Alcesimarchus in *Cistellaria* (The Casket), Argyrippus and Diabolus in *Asinaria*, and Phaedromus in *Curculio*.

#### La Courtille:
Donougher: Located beyond the city walls and therefore exempt from the Parisian tax on wine, La Courtille on the heights of Belleville was where Parisians went to enjoy themselves in its many bars, dance halls and restaurants. Mardi Gras festivities continued there throughout the night and the procession of revellers returning to Paris, known as the *descente de la Courtille*, marked the end of Carnival.

#### Aulus Gellius ... Congrio ... Nodier ... Pulchinello*:
Donougher: The Roman author of *Noctes Atticae* (Attic Nights), written in the mid second century AD and consisting of notes on a wide range of subjects, Aulus Gellius cites the works of many Greek and Latin writers (he mentions 275 by name), for some of whom little else or nothing has survived. Congrio is the cook in Plautus' *Aulularia* (The Pot of Gold), and Aulus Gellius was a great admirer of Plautus. The writer Charles Nodier (1780--1844), a patron and friend of Hugo, was enamoured of Pulchinello and wrote an enthusiastic article celebrating the character ('Polichinelle', *Paris, ou le Livre des Cent-et-un*, vol. 2, Ladvocat: Paris, 1831).

#### Marton ... Pardalisca:
Donougher: Marton is the beautiful country girl ravished by Sire Robert in Voltaire's verse narrative *Ce qui plaît aux dames* (What Pleases Women; 1764). Pardalisca is the clever slave-girl in Plautus' *Casina*.

#### Pantolabus ... Nomentanus:
Donougher: An allusion to two parasitic characters mentioned several times in Horace's *Satires*, Pantolabus as a joker or buffoon (I:2, 8), and Nomentanus as a rake or wastrel (I:1, 2, 8; and as one of the guests at Nasidienus' dinner party, II:8).

#### Café Anglais:
Madden: in the boulevard des Italiens, a centre of fashionable nightlife for most of the nineteenth century.

#### Hermogenes:
Donougher: Mentioned as a good singer (*optimus cantor*) in Horace's *Satires* I:3.

#### Thrasius:
Donougher: An alternative spelling for the Trausius in Horace's Satire on frugality, who is referred to as poor but extravagant, II:2, lines 89--111.

#### Bobèche:
Donougher: Antoine Mandelard (1791--*c.*1841), better known as Bobèche, was a French theatre clown who enjoyed great popularity and success under the first Empire and the Restoration.

#### *Quis properantem me prehendit pallio?*:
Donougher: 'Who is it that tugs me by the cloak when I'm in a hurry?', line 2 of Plautus' *Epidicus*, said by Thesprio to Epidicus.

Madden: From Plautus' play *Epidicus:* "Who stops me in my path, taking me by the cloak."

#### Désaugier's glassful ... Balatro's huge goblet:
Donougher: The hugely successful songwriter Marc-Antoine Désaugier (1772--1827) summed up a whole philosophy of life in the refrain of one of his most popular compositions: 'Verse encor / encor, encor, encor, / encor un rouge bord, / Dieu joufflu de la treille! / Verse encor, / encor, encor, encor. / Par toi tout se réveille, / Et sans toi tout est mort' ('Pour another, / and another, and another, / another brimming glass of red, / Chubby-cheeked god of the vine, / Through you everything wakens, / And without you everything is dead'). At Nasidienus' feast (Horace, *Satires* II:8), guests Balatro and his dining companion Vibidius call for larger glasses (lines 34--6) and serve themselves generously (lines 40--1).

#### Père-Lachaise ... Esquiline:
Donougher: Paris's Père-Lachaise cemetery was opened in 1804 in what was then an outlying district of the city, and only after the remains of La Fontaine, Molière, Abelard and Héloïse were transferred there in 1817 did it become a fashionable burial ground. The eastern slopes of the Esquiline, one of the seven hills of Rome, was at one time a burial place for paupers (see Horace *Satires* I:8, line 10).

#### Trophonius' cave ... Mesmer's tub:
Donougher: Consulting the ancient Greek oracle of Trophonius was a complicated and unnerving experience (as described by Pausanias in his *Description of Greece*, Boeotia, ch. 39), which involved descending into a dark cave. Unable to deal individually with the numbers who flocked to him, the legendary healer Anton Mesmer (1734--1815) developed the *baquet*, a kind of tub around which the patients sat to receive his therapy, based on his theory of animal magnetism. (The commission set up in 1784 to investigate this therapy was headed by Benjamin Franklin, then American ambassador to Paris.)

#### *Ergaphilas ... Cagliostro*:
Donougher: Count Alessandro di Cagliostro (1743--95) was a man whose life was shrouded in mystery and occultism, who has been identified as an Italian adventurer named Giuseppe Balsamo, although Cagliostro himself denied this. He was eventually arrested by spies of the Inquisition and sentenced to death for being a freemason, although this sentence was apparently commuted to life imprisonment. He has enjoyed a long and varied afterlife in numerous literary and musical manifestations. Ergaphilas may be the Athenian general Ergophilus, who shared with Cagliostro the experience of escaping the death sentence (Aristotle, *Rhetoric*, 2.3.13: 'For men grow mild when they have exhausted their anger upon another, as happened in the case of Ergophilus. For although the Athenians were more indignant with him than with Callisthenes, they acquitted him because they had condemned Callisthenes the day before.')

#### Comte de St-Germain:
Donougher: Another eighteenth-century adventurer and self-mythologizer, the Comte de St-Germain impressed, intrigued, even fascinated all those who encountered him, including Horace Walpole, Casanova and Madame de Pompadour.

#### St-Médard ... Umumiye ... Damascus:
Donougher: The tomb of the saintly Jansenist deacon François de Pâris, buried in St-Médard Cemetery in 1727, became a shrine of devotion and the site of miraculous cures among those who flocked to it, many of whom were seized with strange convulsions, a phenomenon that was first recorded in 1731 and persisted for some fifteen years. The great holy shrine in Damascus is the Ummayad Mosque.

#### Mayeux:
Donougher: Like Aesop a hunchback critic of humanity, Mayeux is the character of the social outsider speaking for the ordinary citizen, by means of which the political caricaturist Charles Traviès (1804--59) and others satirized the bourgeoisie and the July Monarchy.

#### Canidia ... Mademoiselle Lenormand:
Donougher: Canidia is a sorceress who appears in three of Horace's texts (*Epodes* 5, 17; *Satires* I:8). Mademoiselle Lenormand (1772--1843) was a renowned fortune-teller, supposedly consulted by Napoleon and the empress Josephine.

Madden: Marie Anne Adelaide Lenormand (1772--1843) was a famous fortune-teller in Paris.

#### rocks tables around at séances:
Madden: Fascinated by the supernatural (and haunted by the death of his favourite daughter, Léopoldine, in 1843), Hugo participated in séances at Hauteville House in Jersey.

#### Dodona:
Donougher: The site of an ancient oracle located in north-western Greece, where the oracle's responses were inferred from the rustling leaves of an oak tree (symbol of Zeus) or from the sound of the wind in the bronze tripods standing around the sanctuary.

#### puts a grisette on the throne:
Madden: a reference to Madame du Barry, who was a [sex worker] before being elevated to the rank of royal mistress.

#### Messalina:
Donougher: The notoriously promiscuous third wife of the Roman emperor Claudius, Messalina has become synonymous with harlotry.

Madden: The legendary sexual appetites and adventures of Claudius' empress fascinated Hugo, among others.

#### Chodruc-Duclos:
Donougher: A diehard royalist, Chodruc-Duclos (1780--1842), once an exceptionally handsome young man, outraged not to be given the high military office he thought he deserved when the monarchy was restored, became a familiar figure on the streets of Paris; like the Greek philosopher Diogenes, he lived the life of a tramp for years until his death. He was on several occasions arrested and even imprisoned, but charges against him were hard to uphold: he could not be called a vagrant since he owned property in his native Gascony, and he argued that the small amounts of money he solicited were loans rather than the fruits of begging.

#### Plutarch:
Donougher: In *De Genio Socratis* (section 6), Plutarch reports 'the excellent answer' that Thales gave when asked by his friends on his return from a long absence abroad what was the most remarkable thing he had seen: 'A tyrant in old age.'

#### Sulla and Domitian:
Donougher: Having defeated his political opponents on the battlefield, Sulla was appointed dictator of Rome in 82 BC; he instituted a reign of terror, after two years abdicated, re-established consular government, then retired. He died in 78 BC. Domitian (51--96) ruled as emperor for fifteen years and is portrayed by Suetonius as a cruel and avaricious tyrant. After he was assassinated in a conspiracy involving those close to him, the Senate condemned his memory to oblivion.

#### *Contra Gracchos Tiberim habemus, Bibere Tiberim, id est seditionem oblivisci*:
Donougher: 'Against the Gracchi we have the Tiber. To drink the Tiber is to forget sedition.' The Gracchi -- Tiberius (163--133 BC) and his younger brother Gaius (154--121 BC) -- were Roman tribunes who, in the context of increasing social unrest among the lower classes of society, attempted to introduce land reform in favour of the poor and met with overwhelming resistance from the Senate. Both Gracchi met with a violent end.

Madden: "Against the Gracchi, we have the Tiber. To drink from the Tiber is to forget sedition."

#### callipygian beauty is a Hottentot:
Donougher: The *Callipygian Venus* is a Roman marble statue dating from the first century BC, which was rediscovered in Rome in the sixteenth century and is now held in the National Archaeological Museum of Naples. The epithet 'callipygian' is from the Greek, meaning 'with beautiful buttocks'. Sara Baartman, who came to England from South Africa in 1810 (and subsequently travelled to Paris where she later died), became known as 'the Hottentot Venus', her physique -- her large buttocks in particular, characteristic of her Khoekhoe origins -- attracting immense curiosity and scientific interest. Her remains were finally returned to South Africa in 2002.

#### hold its nose at Basile:
Donougher: Possibly a reference to Don Basile in Beaumarchais's *Barber of Seville*, as sanctimonious a hypocrite as Molière's character Tartuffe.

#### Tartuffe’s posturing:
Madden: Tartuffe, the sanctimonious hypocrite who lusts for his benefactor's wife, was one of Molière's most enduring characters.

#### Priapus' 'eruption':
Donougher: An allusion to Horace, *Satires* I:8, at the end of which Priapus releases an explosive and what could be interpreted as a flatulent sound to scare off the witches, who run away laughing.

Madden: Priapus, the Greco-Roman god of male fertility, often incarnated male lustiness in popular Roman literature and theatre.

#### the Bal Mabille ... Polymnia ... Janiculum:
Donougher: Originally a dancing institution for the pupils of the dancing-master Jacques Mabille (1772--1845), the Bal Mabille as developed by Mabille's sons became a huge pleasure garden, with music provided by large orchestras and dancing that continued into the night, illuminated by gaslight, in what was still countryside (to the west of Paris). Polymnia was the muse of sacred poetry, and the Janiculum Hill on the west bank of the Tiber, outside the walls of Rome, was a place of sacred woods and shrines.

#### the purveyor of frippery:
Donougher: Clothes dealers exploited young Parisiennes who bought second-hand finery from them on long-term credit (see Philippe Perrot, *Fashioning the Bourgeoisie: A History of Clothing in the Nineteenth Century*, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994).

#### the procuress Staphyla ... the virgin Planesium:
Donougher: Planesium is the virgin slave-girl in Plautus' *Curculio*; the old woman Staphyla in *Aulularia* is the slave of a miserly master whose daughter is pregnant out of wedlock.

#### The Syrian hostess:
Donougher: An allusion to *The Copa*, a Latin poem attributed to Virgil, about a Syrian tavern hostess (*copa*) who invites her clients to enjoy the pleasures of her establishment.

#### Mère Saguet:
Donougher: Immortalized in the title of a posthumously published collection of essays by the poet and novelist Gérard de Nerval (1808--55), the tavern run by Mère Saguet, on the outskirts of the city close to the Moulin de Beurre, was frequented by writers and artists including Hugo himself.

#### David d’Angers, Balzac, and Charlet:
Donougher: The painter and engraver Nicolas-Toussaint Charlet (1792--1845) specialized in Bonapartist themes celebrating the Napoleonic legend.

Madden: The sculptor David d'Angers, the novelist Honoré de Balzac, and the painter and engraver Nicolas-Toussaint Charlet all used contemporary Paris and Parisians as the subjects of their work. Hugo delivered Balzac's eulogy at the Père-Lachaise cemetery in 1850.

#### Adonai:
Donougher: One of the Hebrew names for God in the Old Testament, generally translated 'Lord'.

#### Silenus:
Donougher: In Greek mythology, Silenus was companion and tutor to the wine god Dionysus. A Falstaff-like character, he is often depicted riding on an ass.

#### Ramponneau:
Donougher: Jean Ramponneau (1724--1802) was a wine merchant who ran a celebrated tavern, the Tambour Royal; it was phenomenally successful, partly because he undercut his competitors' prices, and partly because of his own personality, particularly after he broke a contract he had made with a theatre manager, which led to his involvement in a lawsuit that became the talk of the town.

#### Sybaris:
Donougher: Sybaris was a colony founded in southern Italy in the eighth century BC by the Greeks. Its destruction in the late sixth century BC was proverbially blamed on the citizens' overindulgence in the comforts and luxuries their great prosperity had brought them.

#### Pantin:
Donougher: Parisian argot for 'Paris'.

### 3.1.11: To Scoff, to Reign

#### “To please you, O Athenians!” cried Alexander.
Donougher: Carlyle in his 'Essay on Voltaire' (1829) quotes Alexander the Great as saying, 'O Athenians, what toil do I undergo to please you.'

Madden: The source of this quote, apparently referring to the Macedonian Alexander's conquest of Athens, is unclear.

#### Tennis Court Oath:
Donougher: On 20 June 1789 the self-declared National Assembly -- which the king refused to recognize, also denying it entry to the place where it had previously met as the Third Estate in France's parliamentary body, the Estates General -- gathered in a nearby tennis court (*jeu de paume*), where its members took a vow that they would continue their meetings, as the National Constituent Assembly, until they had drawn up a new constitution.

Madden: the celebrated moment of June 20, 1789, when the deputies of the Third Estate declared themselves the representatives of the French nation and vowed that they would not disband until they had established a constitution for France. Within a few days, Louis XVI recognized the former Estates General, with its divisions of the nobility, the clergy, and the common people, as the National Assembly. The ancien régime was legally a thing of the past.

#### night of August 4th:
Donougher: The National Constituent Assembly interrupted its debate on the constitution so as to address the unrest that was spreading throughout France after the storming of the Bastille on 14 July. At the end of a sitting that went on through the night of 4 August, legislation was passed abolishing all feudal rights and privileges in the interests of equality, legitimacy and fairness.

Madden: a dramatic session of the National Assembly on August 4, 1789, when the deputies abolished all fiscal and social privileges of the nobility.

#### *Washington, Kosciuszko ... Botsaris, Riego, Bem*, *Manin, López, John Brown, Garibaldi*:
Donougher: Before he was elected first President of the United States, George Washington (1732--99) was appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War (1775--83). Tadeusz Kosciuszko (1746--1817) was leader of the 1794 uprising against Imperial Russia and the Kingdom of Prussia, having previously served as colonel in the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War. Markos Botsaris (1788--1823) was a Souliote leader and hero of the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire. The Spanish general and liberal politician Rafael del Riego (1784--1823) was one of the leaders of the mutiny in the Spanish Civil War of 1820--3 that led to the reinstatement of the 1812 Constitution. General Józef Bem (1794--1850) was a Polish freedom-fighter who took part in uprisings in Poland, Austria and Hungary. The statesman Daniele Manin (1804--57) led the Venetian revolution against the Austrians in 1848--9, and was an early advocate of Italian unity. Antonio López de Santa Anna (1794--1876) fought for the independence of Mexico from Spanish rule, later becoming a presidential dictator. The American abolitionist and folk hero John Brown (1800--59), executed for murder and treason by the state of Virginia, is remembered in 'John Brown's Body', which became a Union marching song during the American Civil War (1861--5). Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807--82) not only fought successfully for the liberation and unification of Italy, but also during exile in South America for the liberation of Uruguay from Argentina.

Madden: From George Washington to Giuseppe Garibaldi, who as Hugo wrote was working to unify Italy, these men were heroes of nineteenth-century liberalism: Tadeusz Kościuszko (1746--1817) fought in the American Revolution before returning to his native Poland to lead an unsuccessful revolt against Russian rule; Kościuszko died in exile. Simon Bolívar was the great hero of South American independence from Spain. Markos Botzaris (1788--1823) was a leader of the Greek revolt against Ottoman rule. Rafael del Riego (1784--1823) was a leader of the liberal revolt against the king of Spain in 1822. Manin (1804--57) was a leader of the Risorgimento and early advocate of Italian nationalism. Carlos Antonio López (1796--1867) was the first president of Paraguay. Hugo considered the Abolitionist John Brown a hero and martyr. The persons and places named in these passages relate to the movements for independence and liberalism, often republicanism, in Europe (Greece, Italy, Spain, and Hungary) and across South America in the nineteenth century.

#### Boston ... Isla de León ... Pest ... Palermo ... Harpers Ferry ... Ancona ... Gli Archi:
Donougher: The Boston Tea Party was an act of resistance to British rule that was to lead in 1775 to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. A military insurgency on Isla de León (now San Fernando) near Cadiz, in which Riego played so decisive a role, marked the beginning of the Spanish Civil War of 1820--3. The Pest Uprising of 1848 was the start of the ultimately doomed Hungarian Revolution. In one of the most dramatic achievements of the Italian Risorgimento, with a core force of only one thousand men Garibaldi captured Palermo from the Neapolitan Bourbon troops in 1860. He went on to take control of Naples and to hand over his territorial gains in southern Italy to the Piedmontese king Victor Emmanuel II. It was after the attack on the federal armoury and arsenal at Harpers Ferry in 1859, with the intention of arming abolitionists and triggering a slave uprising, that John Brown was tried and executed. Ancona fell to the patriots in September 1860. Gli Archi is a coastal district of Ancona that began to develop outside the walls of the city in the eighteenth century.

Madden: Just as Boston is the cradle of American liberty, the other cities and sites named represent republican and independence movements across Europe in the nineteenth century. "Pest in 1848" refers to the Hungarian uprising against the Hapsburgs. The island of St. Léon was a stronghold for the liberal Spanish insurgents in 1820. In Palermo in 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi led an uprising against the reactionary Bourbon rulers of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

#### Canaris ... Quiroga ... Pisacane:
Donougher: A freedom-fighter during the Greek War of Independence, commanding fire boats that set fire to Turkish warships, Constantinos Canaris (1793/5--1877) rose to become an admiral in the Greek navy and was prime minister of Greece when he died. Colonel Antonio Quiroga (1784--1841) was one of the military leaders of the Spanish Revolution of 1820--23. An Italian socialist revolutionary, Carlo Pisacane (1818--57) was killed leading an abortive insurrection in Campania against the Kingdom of Naples.

#### Byron dies at Missolonghi:
Donougher: Lord Byron (1788--1824) joined the Greeks' revolutionary struggle against Ottoman rule and died at Missolonghi of a fever.

Madden: Lord Byron travelled to Greece in 1824 to join the fight for independence, but died of a fever and subsequent bleedings before he could join in combat.

#### Mazet dies in Barcelona:
Donougher: Author of *Observations on Yellow Fever, Made at Cadiz in* 1819, Dr André Mazet (1793--1821) himself died of yellow fever when, as a member of a French medical team, he returned to Spain to provide assistance during a later outbreak of the disease in Barcelona.

Madden: Dr. Mazet was one of a group of French physicians who travelled to Barcelona in 1821 in order to study and help fight an epidemic of yellow fever; Mazet died after contracting the disease himself. Hugo's 1822 poem "Le Dévouement" was inspired by Mazet and the other members of the humanitarian expedition.

#### a rostrum under Mirabeau’s feet and a crater under the feet of Robespierre:
Donougher: Rejected by his fellow aristocrats as a potential delegate to the Estates General in 1788, Mirabeau (1749--91) with his great oratorial and pamphleteering skills was elected as a commoner to the Third Estate and elected president of the National Assembly three months before he died. Buried in the Panthéon, his remains were removed when it became known he had colluded with the king in a failed attempt to establish a constitutional monarchy.

Madden: After a decidedly ambiguous early life, Honoré-Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, became one of the heroes of the Revolution due to his powerful speeches to the National Assembly. Robespierre was doomed when he became tyrant in the name of republicanism.

##### Pascal ... Molière:
Madden: In Hugo's view, the poets, writers, and thinkers who sought to enlighten (see here) their readers were the true priests of humanity.

#### Régnier:
Donougher: Destined by his family for a career in the Church for which he was by nature ill suited, Mathurin Régnier (1573--1613) was a talented poet of satirical and licentious verse.

#### the temple of Theseus with a charcoal sketch of Bouginier’s nose ... on the Pyramids ‘Crédeville’s a thief’:
Donougher: In the 1830s two graffiti entered Parisian urban mythology (and French literature, in the texts of numerous writers who, like Hugo, recorded the phenomenon): a huge-nosed caricature identified as Bouginier, and the slogan 'Crédeville voleur', sometimes simply the name 'Crédeville'. Their origins remain obscure, although a number of explanations have been offered. Crédeville, for instance, may have been the name of an escaped convict who left his calling-card, as it were, Pink Panther-like, to taunt the police; or the grieving fiancée of some Crédeville taken before his time may have been communicating in this way with her deceased lover; or some victim of a usurer called Crédeville may have been taking his revenge. Gérard de Nerval writes in *Voyage en Orient* that 'Crédeville voleur' and Bouginier's nose are even to be found scrawled on the Pyramids. Privat d'Anglemont has an anecdotal account of Bouginier's nose being used by the first of two separated parties of travellers to lay a trail between Paris and the Pyramids for those following behind them. (See Pierre Enckell, 'Documents pour servir à l'histoire de Crédeville et de Bouginier', in *Études nervaliennes et romantiques III*, Namur: Presses Universitaires de Namur, 1981.) Possibly one sighting was on the Theseion, now known as the temple of Hephaestus, in Athens, where many philhellenes killed in the Greek War of Independence (1821--30) were buried.

Madden: two popular instances of Parisian graffiti that took on lives of their own as the French travelled through Europe. Legend has it that "*Crédéville voleur*" is in fact written at the top of an Egyptian pyramid.

##### Montesquieu ... Danton:
Madden: A chronological list of the writers who over the course of the eighteenth century made it possible for Danton to act on his daring. Montesquieu's (1689--1755) *L'Esprit des lois* (On the Spirit of Laws) is one of the founding documents of the Enlightenment and of modern political science. The mathematician marquis de Condorcet (1749--94), called the last of the *philosophes*, joined the (relatively) moderate Girondin faction in the Convention. Arouet is Voltaire's real name.

#### Montesquieu:
Donougher: One of the great political philosophers of the Enlightenment, Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu (1689--1755), was elected to the French Academy in 1728 but remained something of an outsider, his first election to that institution in 1725 having been declared invalid because he was still resident in Bordeaux, where he was president of the criminal division of the local parliament. His two great works are his *Persian Letters* (1721), giving a view of European society through the eyes of two foreigners, and *The Spirit of the Laws* (1748), a study of different types of government and the legal and social institutions on which they rest.

#### Condorcet:
Donougher: The mathematician, philosopher and political theorist Nicolas de Condorcet (1743--94) was a central figure of the French Enlightenment, who believed in social progress through the power of education and knowledge. He was elected in 1791 to the Legislative Assembly, of which he was briefly president. However, opposed to the death penalty on principle, he voted against the execution of Louis XVI and subsequently defended the Girondists, which led to his own imprisonment. He was found dead in his cell, in circumstances which have never been entirely explained.

#### Arouet:
Donougher: François-Marie Arouet, who adopted the name Voltaire in 1718.

#### "Daring!" is a *fiat lux:*
Madden: Danton rallied the Convention and the Parisian populace to a war footing in 1792, as German and French royalist troops prepared to cross the Rhine, with a passionate speech calling for courageous daring: "*De l'audace, encore de l'audace et toujours de l'audace!" Fiat lux* refers to the first chapter of Genesis: "Let there be light!"

#### the torch of Prometheus to Cambronne's stunted pipe:
Madden: Prometheus brought fire, and thus light (enlightenment), to mortals; in Hugo's view, Cambronne's refusal to surrender ("*Merde!*") was a stand against the governments represented by the armies in the field.

### 3.1.12: The Future Latent in the People

#### *‘Fex urbis!’* exclaims Cicero:
Donougher: 'The excrement of the city', an allusion to Cicero's *Letter to Atticus*, I.16.11.

Madden: i.e., the dregs of the city.

#### 'Mob!' adds Burke:
Donougher: In his *Reflections on the Revolution in France* the Anglo-Irish politician and political theorist Edmund Burke (1729--97) deplored a Revolutionary government whose authority resided in the mob.

Madden: The conservative, traditionalist Edmund Burke supported American independence but was resolutely hostile to the French Revolution.

### 3.1.13: Little Gavroche

#### About eight or nine years after the events recounted in the second part of this story:
Madden: thus, in 1831 or 1832. The July Revolution has in the interim deposed the Bourbons in favour of a new government and new constitution under Louis-Philippe d'Orléans.

#### *Château-d'Eau*:
Donougher: A cast-iron water-tower fountain built in 1811 by Pierre-Simon Girard on the site of what is now Place de la République, it was moved in 1867 to outside the former meat market, now a cultural centre, at La Villette.

#### the boulevard, the Cirque, the Porte Saint-Martin:
Madden: Gavroche, the theatregoer, cab fetcher, and errand runner, haunts the elegant district of theatres like the Porte Saint-Martin and the Cirque around the *grands boulevards* on the right bank.

## Book 2: The Great Bourgeois

### 3.2.1: Ninety Years and Thirty-Two Teeth

#### the Temple:
Madden: The onetime fortress of the Knights Templar, the Temple was part of the Marais neighbourhood, as was the place des Vosges, home of the Hugo family from 1832 to 1848 and today the site of the Victor Hugo Museum. The last remnants of the Temple were destroyed over the course of the nineteenth century.

#### the new Tivoli quartier:
Madden: Also called the *quartier de l’Europe*, for the place de l’Europe, the name Tivoli comes from the Tivoli Gardens, which once occupied the area around today’s Gare Saint-Lazare.

#### a true and complete bourgeois:
Madden: the *grande bourgeoisie*, the wealthy Parisians who lived off private fortunes and were quite content, in the idealized case of Monsieur Gillenormand, with their status in the Second Order.

#### *a sensible fellow* and *Nature*:
Madden: With *sensibilité* and *Nature*, some of the vocabulary, if not the spirit, of Rousseau seems to have entered into Monsieur Gillenormand’s vocabulary.

#### The Opéra *danseuses* are rose-pink cannibals:
Madden: the image of dancers, who were, like actresses, considered part of the demimonde. The verb *manger*, “to eat,” was used to describe the way they devoured their lovers’ fortunes, a literary tradition that ran from *Manon Lescaut* to Zola’s *Nana*. Monsieur Gillenormand longs to be their victim once again.

#### The Caribbeans:
Madden: from the indigenous tribe that inhabited the islands of the Caribbean Sea; i.e., the “natives” or “savages” of European imagination.

### 3.2.2: Like Master, Like House

#### a boudoir:
Madden: not, as is often thought, a bedroom, but a small sitting room, traditionally the site of adulterous assignations. Boudoirs are usually associated with women.

#### Monsieur de Vivonne:
Donougher: The brother of Louis XIV’s mistress Madame de Montespan, Louis-Victor de Rochechouart, later Duc de Vivonne (1636–88), was in charge of the galley fleet from 1669 until his death. Prisoners serving on the galleys were allowed to use skills they might have – and a significant number were textile artisans – to earn money working in port during the winter months when the galleys were not sailing.

Madden: The duc de Vivonne, later duc de Rochechouart, was a great favourite of Louis XIV, who made him Général des Galères, essentially head of the French navy, because of both his military service and the fact that he was the brother of the royal mistress, Madame de Montespan.

#### the man of the court … and the man of the robe:
Madden: a distinction between the *noblesse de cour*, or *d’épée*, and the *noblesse de robe*, the class of magistrates whose offices could be purchased until 1789. Before dedicating his fortune to the acquisition. of mistresses, Monsieur Gillenormand could easily have purchased the second sort of nobility, but he is proud of his own place in the bygone social order.

#### Jordaens:
Donougher: The Flemish Baroque painter Jacob Jordaens (1593–1678).

Madden: Jacob Jordaens, a seventeenth-century Flemish painter.

#### the *incroyables*:
Donougher: Literally, ‘incredibles’, young dandies of the Directory period, who also affected not to pronounce their rs, notably in a favourite catchphrase ‘c’est inc\[r\]oyable’ (‘it’s incredible’).

Madden: Also called *muscadins*, the *Incroyables* were the male counterpart of the *merveilleuses*, whose number included Joséphine de Beauharnais, part of an extravagant and debauched high society that flourished after the fall of the puritanical Robespierre.

### 3.2.3: Luc-Espirit

#### La Camargo and La Sallé:
Donougher: Two leading dancers of the early eighteenth century, Marie-Anne de Cupis de Camargo (1710–70), and Marie Sallé (*c.*1707–56), who began her career in London.

Madden: Marie-Anne Camargo (1710–70) and Marie Sallé (1707–56) were dancers at the Opéra. Voltaire wrote an ode to them that began: “*Ah! Camargo, que vous êtes brillante! / Mais que Sallé, grands Dieux, est ravissante!*”

#### Guimard-Guimardini-Guimardinette:
Donougher: *Guimard*: Marie-Madeleine Guimard (1743–1816), whose career began at the age of fourteen, was the most celebrated dancer of her age.

Madden: Marie-Madeleine Guimard (1743–1816), known simply as La Guimard, was one of the most celebrated *danseuses-courtisanes* of the eighteenth century, whose lovers included the prince de Soubise and the bishop of Orléans.

#### Longchamp:
Madden: The racetrack at Longchamp was a gathering place for high society from the mid-1750s on.

#### her tresses in tightly curled ringlets:
Donougher: Her hair is curled ‘en sentiments soutenus’. I am indebted to M. Alain Ducher, an expert on historical hairstyles, for his explanation: ‘Les boucles sur le cou \[se désignaient sous le nom de\] sentiments … Les sentiments soutenus sont des boucles où une grande partie de la longueur et la pointe est frisée nerveuse’ (‘Tresses on the neck were referred to by the name of *sentiments*. *Les sentiments soutenus* are tresses which along most of their length and at the tip are tightly curled’).

#### Madame de Boufflers:
Donougher: The Marquise de Boufflers (1711–87) was the mistress of King Stanislaw I of Poland.

Madden: Both the marquise de Boufflers and her cousin by marriage, the comtesse de Boufflers, were leading figures in Parisian high society in the late eighteenth century.

#### Corbière! Humann! Casimir Périer!:
Donougher: Jacques-Joseph Corbière (1766–1853), parliamentary deputy and minister of the interior (1821–8); Jean-Georges Humann (1780–1842), parliamentary deputy and minister of finance (1832–4, 1834–6, 1840–2); Casimir Périer (1777–1832), parliamentary deputy, minister of the interior and prime minister (1831–2).

Madden: Jacques-Joseph de Corbière was the son of a carpenter who became minister of the interior from 1821 to 1824; Georges Humann was, like Casimir Périer (see here), a banker and politician; Humann served as minister of finance several times under the July Monarchy, the first time in 1832. For the old-fashioned Monsieur Gillenormand, a bourgeois minister is a ludicrous notion.

#### Luc-Esprit:
Madden: i.e., Saint Luke the Evangelist, and *esprit*, “spirit,” as in Saint-Esprit, the Holy Spirit. *Esprit* also means “wit,” especially in the libertine eighteenth century so dear to Monsieur Gillenormand.

### 3.2.3: A Centenarian Aspirant

#### duc de Nivernais … duc de Nevers:
Donougher:
Louis-Jules Mancini-Mazarini, Duc de Nivernais (1716–98), was a politician, serving as France’s ambassador to Rome, Berlin and London, and a man of letters elected to the Academy in 1742.

Madden: Louis-Jules Mancini-Mazarini (1716–98), the last duc de Nivernais, was the grandson of the duc de Nevers. Monsieur Gillenormand apparently finds the older title more impressive.

#### blue sash:
Donougher: The blue sash – *le cordon bleu* – is that worn by the Knights of the Order of the Holy Spirit, an exclusive body of privileged individuals (and the term *cordon bleu* came by transference to apply to excellence in the culinary field, first appearing in the title of a cookery book in 1827).

Madden: the *cordon bleu* of the Order of the Saint-Esprit, the highest heraldic decoration of the French monarchy.

#### Catherine II … partitioning Poland:
Donougher: Donougher: The signatories to the first partition of Poland in 1772 were Russia (ruled by Catherine the Great), Prussia and Austria.

Madden: In spite of her reputation as an “enlightened despot,” Catherine the Great participated in the partitioning of Poland in 1772 and 1792 and the final absorption of Poland into Russia, Prussia, and Austria in 1795.

#### The gold elixir … Bestuchef’s yellow dye … Lamotte’s drops:
Donougher: The elixir, thought to be a tincture of gold and not only to have remedial powers – as a cure for syphilis – but also to prolong life, was a solution of ferric chloride in alcohol. The Russian count Alexis Bestuchef-Rumin was the first to discover this concoction in 1725, but its secret then fell into the hands of General Lamotte, who produced a version of it in Paris, for which he was awarded a pension by Louis XV. Around 1780 the then holders of the secrets of the preparation presented the recipe to Catherine the Great, who paid them 3,000 roubles and ordered the publication of the tincture’s composition.

Madden: the “gold elixir from Bestuchef” and “Lamotte’s drops” were believed to be cures for the “catastrophes of love,” i.e., venereal disease.

#### ninety-three a second time:
Donougher: The first time would have been 1793, the year of Louis XVI’s execution (January) and the beginning of the Terror (September).

### 3.2.5: Basque and Nicolette

#### turning virtually the whole amount into an annuity:
Madden: i.e. [Gillenormand] purchased a life annuity, a *rente viagère*, that would last his lifetime but leave very little for his heirs.

#### “national property”:
Madden: Beginning in 1790, the properties of *émigrés*, the Catholic Church, and eventually anyone accused of betraying the nation were confiscated and sold to provide revenue for the state.

#### consolidated third of the public debt / *tiers consolidé*:
Donougher: By a law of September 1797 the public debt was reduced to one-third and termed ‘consolidated’, and for the other two-thirds of the debt bonds were issued that immediately became almost worthless, being exchanged in 1800 at 1 per cent of their face value.

Madden: In 1797, the Directory government, faced with a huge public debt, declared that all outstanding government securities would be paid out only at one third of their value. Like the rue Quincampoix, the traditional location of bankers in ancien régime France, such vulgar matters of finance are beneath Monsieur Gillenormand’s attention.

#### Rue Quincampoix:
Donougher: The Scottish economist John Law (1671–1729), appointed controller-general of finances by Louis XV, in 1716 established in Rue Quincampoix the Banque Générale, which developed the use of paper money. Law’s career ended, and fortunes were lost, with the collapse of the bank during the Mississippi Bubble of 1720.

#### Nimois … Picard:
Madden: i.e., from the region around Nîmes, Picardie, the Franche-Comté, or Poitou.

#### incapable of running twenty paces; but, as he had been born at Bayonne, M. Gillenormand called him Basque:
Madden: The city of Bayonne is in the eastern part of the Pyrenees range, on the edge of the Basque country.

Donougher: The name is inappropriate because a popular expression equates a Basque with speed. *Aller/courir comme un Basque*, ‘to go/run like a Basque’, means ‘to move very quickly’.

#### *cordon bleu:*
Madden: here meaning a master chef.

### 3.2.6: In Which Magnon and Her Two Children Are Seen

#### Monsieur le duc d’Angoulême:
Madden: illegitimate son (1573–1650) of Charles IX (born 1550, reigned 1560–74). Such antiquated gossip was relatively well known among the readers of historical memoirs like Monsieur Gillenormand and Victor Hugo.

#### Monsieur Virginal … Cardinal Sourdis:
Donougher: Virginal, Marquis d’Alluye (1584–1602), died without issue by his wife Catherine Hurault. His elder brother François (1574–1628), made cardinal by Pope Clement VIII in 1598, became archbishop of Bordeaux the following year.

#### knight of Malta:
Madden: The crusading order of the Knights Hospitaller of Saint John of Jerusalem were given the island of Malta in 1560. In the eighteenth century, the military-religious order was a convenient honorific to bestow on younger (and bastard) sons, thus limiting the number of eligible heirs to diminishing estates.

#### *Sylvae sint consule dignae*:
Donougher: Virgil, *Eclogue* 4, line 3: ‘Si canimus silvas, silvae sint consule dignae’ (‘If we are to sing of woods, let them be woods worthy of a consul’).

Madden: a pun based on a verse from Virgil’s *Bucolics:* ”Even the woods are worthy of consul.”

#### a soldier of fortune:
Madden: For a traditionalist like Monsieur Gillenormand, the soldiers of the Grande Armée were little better than pirates or highwaymen.

### 3.2.7: Rule: Receive No One Except in the Evening

#### dog-ear style:
Donougher: *Oreilles de chien* (literally, ‘dog’s ears’) or *chien barbet* (‘poodle’) was a hairstyle in vogue among the *incroyables* for about two years at the end of the eighteenth century, with long tresses falling over the ears and the hair pinned up behind.

Madden: The *oreilles de chien* hairstyle, worn long and framing the face on each side, was favoured by the young dandies known as *Incroyables* in the 1790s.

#### the faubourg Saint-Germain … the Marais:
Madden: The faubourg Saint-Germain, the left bank neighbourhood around the boulevard Saint-Germain, was the aristocratic neighbourhood of choice from the mid-eighteenth through the nineteenth centuries. The Marais, built around the place des Vosges, had been the most fashionable address in the seventeenth century; by the July Monarchy, it suggested a sort of faded gentility.

### 3.2.8: Two Do Not Make a Pair

#### bigotry:
Madden: see here; bigotry is meant in the French sense, referring to a rigid, generally conservative set of religious beliefs.

#### the Confraternity of the Virgin:
Madden: Groups such as this, quasi-religious orders for laypeople, thrived in the renewal of devout Catholicism that occurred among the French under the Restoration and especially the July Monarchy.

#### Agnus Deis and the Ave Marias:
Madden: “Lamb of God” and “Hail Mary,” prayers of the Catholic Church.

## Book 3: The Grandfather and the Grandson

### 3.3.1: An Ancient Salon

#### Monsieur de Bonald and even Monsieur Bengy-Puy-Vallée:
Donougher: Louis de Bonald (1754–1840), appointed minister in 1822 and made a peer in 1823, was a critic of the Enlightenment and an advocate of aristocratic institutions.

A friend of de Bonald, Philippe Bengy-Puy-Vallée (1743–1823), of noble descent, served in the pre-Revolutionary army, fled France as an émigré, then returned under the Consulate.

Madden: two paragons of ultra-royalism under the Restoration. The vicomte de Bonald (1754–1840) was an influential writer and legislator; Monsieur Bengy-Puy-Vallée was rather more obscure, and there may be some irony in the pairing of these two names.

#### la baronne de T——:
Madden: There is no obvious model for the baroness, but ambassadorships, particularly to a capital as important as Berlin, were typically given only to the highest nobility under the ancien régime.

#### a very mixed bag:
Madden: i.e., the Restoration court, which included members of the imperial aristocracy.

#### the Jacobinism of Louis XVIII:
Madden: Compared to his family and the ultra-royalists, Louis XVIII, who deemed 1814 the nineteenth year of his reign, was considered a moderate for his conciliatory pragmatism. Hugo barely exaggerates the attitude of the Ultras.

#### Monsieur, later Charles X:
Madden: Monsieur, the comte d’Artois, was far more conservative than his elder brother, and his succession to the throne in 1824 was seen by the Ultras as a chance to turn back the historical clock.

#### the federates:
Donougher: The National Guardsmen from the provinces, summoned by the Legislative Assembly in 1792 to celebrate the storming of the Bastille at the Festival of Federation (those from Marseille bringing the ‘Marseillaise’ with them to Paris), were referred to as ‘the federates’. They went on to storm the Tuileries on 10 August.

Madden: the name given volunteers for the regional National Guards in the early years of the Revolution. It was the federates of Marseilles who first sang the “Marseillaise,” which these lyrics parody.

#### the Dessolles ministry … Deserre:
Madden: The marquis de Dessolles was president of the Council of Ministers (prime minister) from 1817 to 1819; Élie Decazes, who had become the favourite of Louis XVIII—who called him “*mon cher fils*”—was minister of the interior; and George Deserre was minister of justice. All three were moderately liberal politicians.

#### In order to re-establish … must be changed.
Pour raffermir le trône ébranlé sur sa base,<br/>
Il faut changer de sol, et de serre et de case.<br/>

Donougher translation:<br/>
To restore the shaken throne to a firmer footing,<br/>
Requires a change ‘de sol [Dessolles], et de serre [Deserre] et de case [Decazes]’.<br/>
Footnote: ‘Of soil, and of glasshouse and of dwelling’.

#### Damas, Sabran, Gouvion-Saint-Cyr:
Donougher: ‘Sabrant’ (‘sabring’) being a homophone of ‘Sabran’: ‘Damas *sabring* Gouvion St-Cyr’.

Donougher: After a military career Ange Hyacinthe Maxence de Damas de Cormaillon, Baron de Damas (1785–1862) served briefly under the Restoration as minister of war and minister of foreign affairs; Comte Elzéar-Louis-Zozime de Sabran (1764–1847) served in the émigré army and in 1814 was made a general by Louis XVIII; Laurent de Gouvion St-Cyr (1764–1830) distinguished himself in the Napoleonic Wars but his opposition to Napoleon becoming emperor delayed his promotion to marshal. He served as minister of war under the Restoration and was made marquis in 1817.

Madden: The marquis de Gouvion-Saint-Cyr (1764–1830) and the baron de Damas (1785–1862) were both aristocrats who served in the imperial armies and then the Restoration government, Damas succeeding Saint-Cyr as minister of war under Louis XVIII. The inclusion of Sabran in this list is not clear.

#### Ça ira:
Ah ! ça ira ! ça ira ! ça ira !<br/>
Les buonapartist’ à la lanterne !<br/>

Donougher translation:<br/>
Ah! it’ll come! it’ll come! it’ll come!<br/>
Bonapartists from lamp-posts strung!<br/>

Donougher: *Ça ira* is an idiomatic expression meaning ‘Things will work out’ or ‘We’ll get there.’ It was supposedly Benjamin Franklin’s answer when asked in Paris how the American War of Independence was going. The refrain of this Revolutionary song – ‘Ah! ça ira! ça ira! ça ira! / Les aristocrates à la lanterne!’ (the salon members substitute the word ‘Bonapartists’ for ‘aristocrats’) – was so popular that it was sung as the refrain of another Revolutionary song, the ‘Carmagnole’. Both songs were banned in 1799 when Napoleon became first consul.

Madden: a popular and violent revolutionary song that celebrated the hanging of aristocrats from the lampposts of Paris. The denizens of Madame de T——’s salon have replaced the aristocrats with “Buonapartists” in their lyrics.

#### Fualdès affair:
Donougher: The brutal murder, in March 1817, of the retired prosecutor Antoine-Bernardin Fualdès (born 1761) and the subsequent trials – the first was declared a mistrial on a legal technicality – created a sensation and were covered widely in the press, both in France and abroad. Indicative of the huge interest is Mary Shelley’s request, in a letter from Italy dated 30 April 1818 addressed to Thomas Love Peacock, for a publication about the trial to be sent out to her (*The Letters of Thomas Love Peacock: 1792*–*1827*, ed. Nicholas A. Joukovsky, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 132). Charles Bastide-Gramont (godson of Fualdès), Joseph Jausion and Jean-Baptiste Collard were executed for the murder. The whole affair remains contentious.

Madden: In 1817, Antoine-Bernadin Fualdès, a former public prosecutor (*procureur impérial*) under the Napoleonic government, was brutally murdered in Rodez. Two men named Bastide and Jausion were arrested, convicted, and executed in Toulouse in 1818. The sensational case was closely followed throughout France.

#### the brothers and friends:
Madden: a mocking allusion to the Revolutionary ideal of *fraternité*.

#### the comte de Lamothe-Valois … the necklace affair … strange amnesties:
Donougher: The involvement of the Comte de Lamothe-Valois (or more usually La Motte; 1755–1831) in the necklace affair, a fraud perpetrated by his wife, who arranged the forging of Marie-Antoinette’s signature in order to acquire a diamond necklace for herself – and which was exploited by anti-royalists to discredit the queen – should have made him anathema to this royalist salon.

Madden: Antoine-Nicolas Lamothe, or Lamotte, a fraudulent count who married Jeanne de Valois-Saint-Rémy (1756–91), the descendant of a bastard of the Valois dynasty. The comte de Lamothe-Valois and his wife had been the principal orchestrators of the “Necklace Affair,” an ancien régime scandal that had badly damaged the public image of the royal family, hence the “strange amnesties.”

#### Marigny … La Pompadour … Prince de Soubise:
Donougher: Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson, Madame de Pompadour (1721–64), was Louis XV’s mistress from 1745 until her death. Her brother Abel became Marquis de Marigny in 1754. The Prince de Soubise, Charles de Rohan (1715–87), was a protégé of Madame de Pompadour, and through her influence was given command of an army during the Seven Years War (1756–63); he suffered a humiliating defeat at the battle of Rossbach in 1757.

Madden: Louis XV had made his mistress’s brother, Abel Poisson, the marquis de Marigny.

Madden: The prince de Soubise was a member of the Rohan family, who claimed descent from the ancient kings of Brittany. He was the father-in-law (and cousin) of the prince de Guéménée, whose bankruptcy in 1782 was still another scandal for the court aristocracy.

#### Du Barry, godfather of La Vaubernier … Richelieu:
Donougher: Jean-Baptiste du Barry (1723–94) established as a courtesan Jeanne Vaubernier (1743–93), who attracted the attentions of Armand du Plessis, Maréchal Duc de Richelieu (1696–1788), a renowned libertine. In 1768 du Barry arranged for her to be married to his brother Comte Guillaume du Barry (1732–1811) so that she could become the official mistress of Louis XV.

Madden: “Godfather” could not be used more ironically. Jean du Barry was the patron and brother-in-law of Madame du Barry, née Jeanne Bécu, Vaubernier being the name of her father, a monk at the Picpus monastery in Paris. Du Barry married the beautiful young [sex worker] to his elder brother, the comte du Barry, in order to give her entry into high society and thus a better clientele. She eventually became the mistress of Louis XV.

Madden: Monsieur le maréchal de Richelieu was one of the celebrated *grands seigneurs* and libertines of the eighteenth century. The ducs de Richelieu were the (indirect) descendants and heirs of the cardinal de Richelieu.

#### Mercury … Prince de Guéménée … A thief:
Donougher: Henri de Rohan, Prince de Guéménée (1745–1809), son-in-law of the Prince de Soubise, declared bankruptcy in 1782, owing the colossal sum of 33 million francs. The Greek god Hermes (Mercury in the Roman pantheon) is characterized in classical literature as a thief, associated in particular with the theft of Apollo’s oxen (‘of many shifts, blandly cunning, a robber, a cattle driver, a bringer of dreams, a watcher by night, a thief at the gates’ – *Homeric Hymn IV, To Hermes*, lines 13–15). He is also the patron of (among others) thieves.

Madden: Hermes in Greek mythology, the messenger god was also a thief and a prankster.

#### the Valois name:
Donougher: This de Lamothe acquired by his marriage to Jeanne de Valois-St-Rémy (1756–91). The House of Valois was a cadet branch of the French royal family that unexpectedly succeeded to the throne in 1328 – the crisis over the succession precipitated the Hundred Years War (1337–1543) between England and France – and reigned until 1589.

#### Count von Ruppin:
Donougher: The Hohenzollern dynasty first acquired the title ‘Margrave of Brandenburg’ in 1415, and early on took over the smaller fiefdom of Ruppin. They were granted the title ‘king’ in Prussia in 1701, and only in 1772 did Frederick II adopt the title ‘King of Prussia’. When travelling, Frederick the Great occasionally made use of the title Count von Ruppin.

#### the king of Prussia … marquis de Brandenburg:
Madden: By tradition, monarchs travelling in foreign lands used assumed names in order to facilitate protocol—Louis XVIIII in exile was known as the comte de Lille. Louis XVIII, the alleged Jacobin, considered himself the scion of the oldest dynasty in Europe and first among equals with other monarchs, and thus alienated the rulers of the countries that had restored him to his throne with his “refined impertinence”—when Czar Alexander I arrived for a meeting, Louis never asked him to sit down. Marquis (margrave) de Brandenburg was the ancient title of the Hohenzollerns before they became electors and then kings of Prussia.

#### *Courrier français:*
Madden: a liberal-leaning newspaper (several newspapers of various political stripes have been published with that title).

#### Monsieur de Talleyrand:
Madden: Monsieur Gillenormand, and Hugo, take their inspiration from Chateaubriand, who, having seen the clubfooted Talleyrand and Fouché arriving for an audience with Louis XVIII after Waterloo, later wrote, “And then Vice entered, supported by Crime, M. de Talleyrand leaning on the arm of M. Fouché.”

#### brigand of the Loire:
Donougher: After the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo and the capitulation of Paris in July 1815, the army under the command of General Louis-Nicolas Davout (1770–1823) withdrew to the Loire region and was often referred to by royalists as ‘the brigands of the Loire’.

Madden: After Waterloo and Napoléon’s abdication, the soldiers loyal to him retreated beyond the Loire River before officially surrendering.

### 3.3.2: One of the Red Spectres of That Epoch

#### that beautiful stone bridge:
Donougher: A medieval construction originally of twenty-five arches of which only eight were still standing in 1830, the stone bridge of Vernon was replaced in 1860 by a new stone bridge, the Pont Napoléon, renamed the Pont Clemenceau in 1930. This bridge was destroyed in 1940, and after a series of temporary replacements a new concrete-built Pont Clemenceau was inaugurated in 1954.

#### Vernon:
Madden: a small town on the Seine in Normandy, about forty miles from Paris. Colonel Baron Pontmercy’s exile has certain parallels with that of General Count Hugo, although the author’s father lived in Blois, on the banks of the Loire, and the woman he lived with was his mistress, not an old servant.

#### Soulange-Bodin:
Donougher: Étienne Soulange-Bodin (1774–1846) was a French horticulturalist, who created a botanical garden of some 170 acres at Fromont, about fifteen miles south-east of Paris. He was a pioneer in breeding hybrid magnolias and has given his name to the *Magnolia X soulangeana*.

Madden: Étienne Soulange-Bodin (1774–1846) made great advances in botany.

#### Georges Pontmercy:
Madden: There are many indirect parallels between the careers of Marius’s father and Victor Hugo’s. Both were simple soldiers who rose through the ranks through battlefield promotions. Both fought in Germany and then in Italy, but General Hugo remained in Italy, where he eventually became Joseph Bonaparte’s aide-de-camp before following *le roi Joseph* to Spain in 1808, remaining there until 1813. In 1814, General Hugo was sent to command the fortified town of Thionville, where he held out against the allies even after Napoléon had surrendered and embarked for Elba. During the Hundred Days, Napoléon sent him back to Thionville, which he again held after the final abdication. It was only in November 1815, some five months after Napoléon had been shipped off to Saint Helena, that General Hugo surrendered.

#### Saintonge regiment:
Donougher: The Saintonge regiment fought in the American Revolutionary War as part of the French expeditionary force sent to support the Americans. Its two battalions were absorbed into brigade formations in 1794 and 1796.

#### *Speyer, Worms, Neustadt, Turckheim, Alzey and Mainz … Andernach … Marchiennes … Mont-Palissel*:
Donougher: Engagements in the Rhineland and in northern France during the French Revolutionary Wars of 1792–7.

Madden: battles of the Revolutionary armies in the early 1790s. Pontmercy’s military career follows Napoléon to Waterloo, making it somewhat more glamorous than General Hugo’s, which was spent mostly in the Napoleonic quagmire in Spain.

#### Houchard’s rear guard … Audernach:
Donougher: General Jean-Nicolas Houchard (1738–1793), a soldier of humble origins, rose through the ranks to a position of command that exceeded his capabilities. Appointed commander-in-chief of the Army of the North in 1793, during the French Revolutionary Wars, he was arrested on charges of cowardice for his failure to pursue the enemy after winning the battle of Hondschoote in September 1793. Despite the many scars of battle that he bore, he was found guilty by the Revolutionary Tribunal and sent to the guillotine.

Madden: General Jean-Nicolas Houchard (1740–1793) was guillotined in November 1793, after attempting a strategic retreat to Audernach that turned into a rout of French armies by the forces of the prince of Hesse.

#### the Col di Tenda with Joubert:
Donougher: General Barthélemy-Catherine Joubert (1769–99): ‘In 1791 \[Joubert\] enrolled as a volunteer, and served in all the lower ranks, from that of an ordinary grenadier. Having been made an infantry lieutenant, he was charged in September 1793 with the defence of a redoubt on the Col di Tenda: surrounded by five hundred Piedmontese, it was only after a spirited resistance that he was taken prisoner’ (Louis-Gabriel Michaud, *Biographie Universelle*, 1843). Joubert was killed at the battle of Novi (15 August 1799).

Madden: Barthélemy Catherine Joubert (1769–99), Napoléon’s successor commanding the Army of Italy, was defeated by the Austrians and their Russian allies before being killed at the battle of Novi in August 1799.

#### Berthier’s … gunner, trooper and grenadier … Lodi:
Donougher: Louis-Alexandre Berthier (1753–1815) was Napoleon’s chief of staff, serving him in that post from 1794. The words are from a letter of 11 May 1796 written by Napoleon to the Directory, the day after the battle of Lodi, when the bridge held by the Austrians was taken by the French.

Madden: Prince Louis-Alexandre Berthier (1753–1815) was Napoléon’s chief of staff and closest confidant. Lodi was a significant victory (May 1796) in establishing General Bonaparte’s reputation as the heroic commander of the Army of Italy.

#### the red, white, and blue:
Madden: i.e., the tricolour flag that was still the symbol of the Consulate.

#### Malher … Günzburg:
Donougher: Jean-Pierre Firmin Malher (1761–1808) was general of division at the battle of Günzburg, in October 1805, where the French succeeded in capturing from the Austrians the bridge over the Danube.

#### Wertingen … Maupetit:
Donougher: Colonel Pierre Maupetit distinguished himself as described at the battle of Wertingen on 8 October 1805, and although reported in the army bulletin to have been mortally wounded, he survived. He was named Commander of the Legion of Honour at Austerlitz (2 December 1805), promoted to general of brigade in 1806 after the battle of Jena, and made a baron of the Empire in 1808; he died in 1811.

Madden: an early French victory in the 1805 campaign that culminated in the defeat of Austria and Russia at Austerlitz.

#### the 4th Line:
Donougher: The Russian Horse Guards captured from the 4th Line the only French colour that was lost at Austerlitz.

#### Wurmser taken prisoner in Mantua … Mack in Ulm:
Madden: three Austrian generals forced to surrender to French armies: Wurmser at Mantua in 1797; Mélas in Alexandria in June 1800; and Mack at Ulm, in Germany, in 1805, a prelude to Napoléon’s victory at Austerlitz.

#### Mortier … Hamburg:
Donougher: Édouard-Adolphe Mortier (1768–1835) served in the French Revolutionary Wars and was one of the first marshals Napoleon created. He led the occupation of Hamburg on 19 November 1806. Having served under Louis-Philippe as French ambassador to Russia, as minister of war and prime minister, he was killed in Fieschi’s attempt on Louis-Philippe’s life (see note p. 1386 on *the Fieschi conspiracy*).

#### Eylau … Louis Hugo:
Donougher: Hugo’s paternal uncle Louis (1777–1853) was awarded the Legion of Honour for his part in the battle of Eylau, fought against the Russians in East Prussia in February 1807. His defence of the cemetery is told in Victor Hugo’s poem ‘Le Cimetière d’Eylau’, published in the second series of his epic cycle *La Légende des Siècles*, on which he began work in 1862 and which was published in 1877.

Madden: a hard-won victory over the Russians and Prussians (February 1807); it was Eylau and even more so the victory at Friedland the following June that led Czar Alexander to accept negotiations, leading to the meeting of the two emperors at Tilsit in July.

Madden: Hugo’s poem “Le Cimetière d’Eylau” tells the story of [Louis Hugo’s] heroic stance.

#### Moscow, then the Beresina:
Madden: The scorched-earth tactic of the Russians made the taking of Moscow (September 1812) a Pyrrhic victory. Forced to retreat, the already weakened Grande Armée was trapped, on November 26, between a pursuing Russian force and the Beresina River, where the ice proved too weak to support the planned passage of the army. As the engineering corps raced to fashion a bridge, more than 10,000 French troops were killed, either by drowning or by Cossacks.

####  Lützen, Bautzen … Gelenhausen:
Madden: battles of the 1813 campaign in Germany, all victories except for the battle of Leipzig (October 16–19), also known as the Battle of Nations, which forced Napoléon to retreat to French territory for the last time.

####  Montmirail, Château-Thierry … Laon:
Madden: battles of the defensive “French Campaign” as Napoléon’s armies fell back in the face of the allied advance toward Paris. As with his résumé of the German campaign, Hugo ends his list of Pyrrhic victories with a defeat, that of the battle of Laon on March 10.

#### Arnay-le-Duc:
Donougher: This perhaps should be Bar-le-Duc, some 130 miles east of Paris, close to St-Dizier, where Napoleon won his last victory on 26 March 1814. Hugo may be referring to events that took place near by at what is referred to as the second battle of Fère-Champenoise on 25 March 1814, in which some 3,500 young and inexperienced National Guardsmen were killed making a heroic stand under General Michel-Marie Pacthod (1764–1830), whose arm was shattered in the fighting. Arnay-le-Duc is 155 miles south-east of Paris, in Burgundy, and not on the route of the retreating army.

#### Eight days before the capitulation:
Madden: General Marmont signed an armistice with the Allies at 2 A.M. on March 31, 1814; allied armies entered Paris later that day, while Napoléon retreated to Fontainebleau. On April 3, the imperial legislature pronounced Napoléon’s removal as emperor; on April 4, he abdicated, under the condition that his four-year-old son be recognized as Emperor Napoléon II, under the regency of Empress Marie-Louise; the Allies refused his conditions; on April 6, Napoléon abdicated unconditionally while his senate, under the leadership of Talleyrand, voted a proclamation recognizing Louis XVIII as king of the French. Pontmercy’s refusal to surrender recalls General Hugo’s holdout at Thionville.

#### half pay:
Madden: One of the great blunders of the first Restoration was, in 1814, to place large numbers of officers on half pay (*demi-solde*), a quasi-official retirement with inadequate pension. This policy made the army far more receptive to Napoléon’s return from Elba.

#### King Louis XVIII … recognized neither … title as baron:
Madden: Like Pontmercy’s, the title granted to General Hugo (count of Siguenza and Sifuentes) was never officially registered in Paris and was thus unrecognized by the Restoration.

#### Sir Hudson Lowe:
Madden: governor of Saint Helena, the final villain of the Napoleonic saga.

#### Flaminius:
Donougher: The third-century Roman consul Gaius Flaminius was killed at the battle of Lake Trasimene in 217 BC, when the great Carthaginian general Hannibal (247–183 BC) ambushed and destroyed the Roman army during the Second Punic War (218–202 BC), which began on the Iberian peninsula where the Romans may have taken some Carthaginians prisoner.

#### The greatest families are forced to do it:
Madden: Napoléon aggressively encouraged marriages between the old nobility of the faubourg Saint-Germain and the new nobility of his marshals, generals, and colonels.

#### the legacy from Mademoiselle Gillenormand:
Madden: French law closely governed questions of inheritance.

#### hiding behind a pillar:
Madden: When their parents had a falling-out, the very young Victor Hugo would hide behind a pillar at Saint-Sulpice in order to see his future wife, Adèle Foucher, attending mass in the company of her mother.

#### St George’s Day:
[Marius’s] father’s name-day.

### 3.3.3: Requiescant

#### Requiescant:
Donougher: Part of the liturgical formula *Requiescant in pace* (‘May they rest in peace’).

#### monorhymed odes:
Donougher: Odes in which all the lines have the same end-rhyme.

#### d’Espinouse:
Donougher: In response to a letter he had received from the Marquis Charles-Louis-Alexandre de Coriolis d’Espinouse (1770–1841) Hugo wrote a poem entitled ‘Écrit en 1846’ (Written in 1846), published in his collection *Les Contemplations* of 1856: ‘Marquis, je m’en souviens, vous veniez chez ma mère, / Vous me faisiez parfois réciter ma grammaire …’ (‘Marquis, I remember, you used to visit my mother, / You sometimes made me recite my grammar …’).

#### the man best versed in ‘proportionate politeness’:
Donougher: An allusion to Saint-Simon’s descriptions in his *Mémoires* of the theologian Fénelon: ‘a politeness that, while being all-embracing, was always measured and proportionate’, vol. 9, ch. 12 (1711); and ‘an insinuating but noble and proportionate politeness’, vol. 11, ch. 22 (1715).

#### the salon of Madame de T——:
Madden: this crowded salon is something of a reflection of the atmosphere the adolescent Victor Hugo grew up in. Madame Hugo liked to blame her failed marriage on her royalist principles, and if the company she kept was far less grand than Madame de T——’s guests (Beauffremont, Clermont-Tonnerre, and la Luzerne are some of the great names of the old aristocracy), the Revolution and Empire were vilified by Hugo’s mother and her friends. While most of the baroness’s guests are real people, only those who played some larger role in history or Hugo’s life are discussed here. As the title of the chapter makes clear, Madame de T—— and her guests are living relics of another time.

#### Trestaillon:
Madden: leader of a violent royalist reaction—*the Terreur blanche*—in the south of France (see here).

#### the ‘unfindable’ kind:
Donougher: The ultra-royalist Chamber of Deputies elected in August 1815 was referred to by Louis XVIII as ‘introuvable’ (‘unfindable’), meaning that he could not have found a more royalist Chamber if he had tried. When the extremism of the ‘introuvable’ Chamber became a threat to the survival of the monarchy, the Assembly was dissolved by the king, in September 1816, and new elections returned more moderates.

#### the famous right-wing taunter:
Donougher: Charles Nicolas Cornet-Dincourt (1773–1852) in 1816 proposed suspending the freedom of the press entirely, and restoring unsold assets to the Church.

#### The bailiff of Ferrette … on his way to Monsieur de Talleyrand’s:
Donougher: The county of Ferrette in Alsace came under the jurisdiction of Austria in 1324 and was ruled by a royal official known as the *bailli* (‘bailiff’) de Ferrette. In *La Muse du Département*, set in 1820s and 30s, Balzac writes of the bailiff that he was said to be ‘l’homme le plus courageux de l’Europe parce qu’il osait marcher sur ses deux jambes’ (‘the bravest man in Europe for daring to walk on his legs’); and that he was accused ‘de mettre du plomb dans ses souliers, pour ne pas être emporté par le vent’ (‘of putting lead in his shoes to save himself from being blown away’).

Madden: Talleyrand, a rich European celebrity, had a house that was a gathering place for those elements of Parisian high society who were less ideological than Madame de T—— and her guests. For an old libertine like the bailiff of Ferrette, Talleyrand’s house would have been far more agreeable.

#### the comte d’Artois:
Madden: In his pre-Revolutionary youth, the future Charles X had been the only Bourbon of his generation to uphold the family tradition of libertinage. Time and the death of his favourite mistress led him back to the Church.

#### Aristotle … Campaspe … La Guimard:
Donougher: The story arose in the thirteenth century that when the philosopher Aristotle remonstrated with his pupil Alexander the Great for allowing himself to be distracted from more important things by his mistress, she took her revenge by using her charms to make Aristotle fall in love with her, to the point where he allowed her to ride on his back. When challenged about his behaviour, the philosopher replied that he had proved precept by example: if a man of his age and wisdom could be made a fool of by a woman, how much more dangerous must she be to a young man? While Pliny the Elder wrote in his *Natural History* that Campaspe was a favourite mistress of Alexander’s, the woman who seduced Aristotle is more usually given the name Phyllis. George Sarton in an article published in 1930 (‘Aristotle and Phyllis’, *Isis*, vol. 14, no. 1, p. 13) cites a reference to a French parlour game called *le cheval d’Aristote* (‘Aristotle’s horse’), in which as a forfeit a man is obliged to crawl around the room on all fours with one of the ladies on his back.

Madden: According to a medieval legend, the Athenian courtesan Campaspe, or Phyllis, the mistress of Alexander the Great, seduced Aristotle and, as proof of his love, demanded that he allow her to ride his back while he crawled on all fours. For medieval moralists, this was a warning of the perfidy of woman, the dangers of desires of the flesh, and the arrogance of human intellect. “La Guimard” refers to one of the famous courtesans of the eighteenth century (see here).

#### Abbé Halma … La Foudre:
Donougher: Nicolas Halma (1755–1828), scholar and translator, notably of the Greek astronomer Ptolemy’s *Almageste* (1813). *La Foudre* was a royalist newspaper, founded in 1820 by Emmanuel Théaulon (1787–1841), who had earlier founded another royalist paper, *Le Nain Rose* – whose name perhaps suggested to Hugo the name Monsieur Larose.

#### the abbé Frayssinous:
Donougher: Abbé Denis de Frayssinous (1765–1841), bishop of Hermopolis, in 1822 was elected to the Academy and appointed grand master of the university. In 1824 he became minister of public education and ecclesiastical affairs, and delivered the funeral oration for Louis XVIII. In Flaubert’s *Madame Bovary* (pt 1, ch. 6) we read: ‘Le soir, avant la prière, on faisait dans l’étude une lecture religieuse. C’était, pendant la semaine, quelque résumé d’Histoire sainte ou les *Conférences* de l’abbé Frayssinous …’ (‘In the evening, before prayers, there would be a religious reading in the study. During the week it would be a commentary on some biblical story or Abbé Frayssinous’s *Lectures …*’).

Madden: Denis-Antoine-Luc Frayssinous (1765–1841), an intimate of Charles X.

#### the illustrious Liberian basilica:
Donougher: The Basilica of Sta Maria Maggiore in Rome, called ‘Liberian’ after its original founder, Pope Liberius (352–66).

#### advocate of the saints:
Madden: In the “trials” that determine if a candidate is fit for sainthood, the advocate of the saints pleads the case of the nominee, while the devil’s advocate offers the counterevidence.

#### master of requests:
Donougher: Occupying a high-level position dating back to the Middle Ages, a *maître des requêtes* is a judicial officer whose role originally was to examine petitions (*requêtes*) to the Royal Household. In post-Revolutionary France masters of requests are members of the Council of State, which provides the government with legal advice.

#### *Le Conservateur* … Chateaubriand:
Donougher: A royalist newspaper published from October 1818 to March 1820, with which Chateaubriand was closely associated.

Madden: *Le Conservateur* was the Ultra newspaper Chateaubriand contributed to when he was dismissed from Louis XVIII’s government in 1816, which in turn inspired the young and still royalist Hugo brothers to found *Le Conservateur littéraire* in 1818.

#### hating the Encyclopaedia:
Donougher: Compiled and edited by Denis Diderot and Jean d’Alembert (1718–83), the *Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers* (Encyclopaedia, or Classified Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts and Trades) consisted of 28 volumes and contained over 70,000 entries and over 3,000 illustrations. Published over the years 1751–72 and expanded by successive editors, it was intended to be a comprehensive corpus of world knowledge to be made available to the reading public and to future generations. With signed contributions by some of the greatest minds of the age, it represents one the highest achievements of the Enlightenment.

Madden: Diderot’s *Encyclopédie* of 1751–72.

#### one of the Forty:
Donougher: The forty members of the Academy included Jean-Armand de Roquelaure (1721–1818), elected in 1771. He was bishop of Senlis from 1754 to 1801; the see of Senlis was then suppressed and absorbed into the see of Beauvais.

#### *Vibraye … Talaru … Herbouville … Dambray … Valentinois*:
Donougher: Anne-Victor-Denis Hurault, Marquis de Vibraye (1767–1843); Louis-Justin-Marie, Marquis de Talaru (1769–1850); Charles-Joseph-Fortuné, Marquis de Herbouville (1756–1829); Charles-Henri, Vicomte Dambray (1760–1829). The title of Duc de Valentinois, awarded to the Grimaldi house of Monaco by Louis XIII in 1642, was held during 1777–1814 by Honoré IV of Monaco (1758–1819).

#### White—legitimist—Paris society:
Madden: i.e., commited to the Bourbons.

#### Chateaubriand … Père Duchesne:
Madden: As with Louis XVIII’s “Jacobinism,” the conservative but constitutional monarchist Chateaubriand can be compared to the violently revolutionary *Père Duchesne* (see here) only by almost fanatical ultra-royalists.

#### Comte Beugnot:
Donougher: Jacques-Claude Beugnot (1761–1835) was elected to the Legislative Assembly for 1791–2 and 1816–20.

Madden: Jacques-Claude Beugnot (1761–1835) came from an old family of the robe nobility but served both the Napoleonic and Restoration governments.

#### The “noble” salons of today … to their credit:
Madden: Hugo is apparently referring to the Paris of 1860–62, when the futility of royalism made those who adhered to it admirable, while “‘noble’ salons” did nothing to oppose the tyranny of Louis-Napoléon.

#### the duchesses de Longueville and de Chevreuse:
Madden: heroines of the Fronde, the period of aristocratic rebellion against Cardinal Mazarin, who animate the memoirs of the ducs de La Rochefoucauld and Saint-Simon.

#### besmirched by the usurper:
Madden: The “usurper” is, of course, Napoléon, who required his courtiers to address him as “Your Majesty” and “Sire.”

#### Methuselah informed Epimenides:
Donougher: The third-century-AD biographer of the Greek philosophers Diogenes Laertius tells us that Epimenides of Knossos fell asleep for fifty-seven years, and when he awoke after what he thought was a short nap he was bewildered by the changes that had taken place in the meantime.

Madden: Methuselah lived for 967 years, according to the book of Genesis, while in Greek legend, Epimenides fell asleep in a cave for fifty-seven years.

#### The time … since Koblenz:
Donougher: Many of the royalist émigrés who fled France after the Revolution gathered in Koblenz in the Rhineland, where Louis XVI’s brothers the Comte de Provence (the future Louis XVIII) and the Comte d’Artois (later Charles X) had taken up residence, and where the Prince de Condé commanded an émigré army. In 1794 Koblenz fell to the Revolutionary army in the French Revolutionary Wars.

Madden: the German city where royalist émigrés organized an ultimately unsuccessful counterrevolutionary invasion of France.

#### the advent of Monsieur de Villèle:
Madden: The appointment of Villèle to the post of prime minister was seen as a triumph for the Ultras, even if he eventually proved too pragmatic for the Right.

#### revenants:
literally, “those who have returned”; this is also the French word for ghosts.

#### *ci-devants*:
Madden: The term used to describe “former” noblemen during the Revolution, *ci-devant* came to refer to those aristocrats who clung to the traditions of the ancien régime.

#### the nobility of the Crusades:
Madden: The ideal of the French aristocracy under the ancien régime, when custom dictated that only those who could prove four hundred years of noble ancestry could be presented at court. In the eighteenth century, some notoriously creative geneaologies were used to gain access to court.

#### Fontenoy … Marengo:
Madden: battles of the ancien régime and the Empire, respectively.

#### the sword of Fontenoy:
Donougher: The battle of Fontenoy was a pre-Revolutionary French victory in 1745 during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–48).

#### called Bonaparte ‘Scapin’:
Donougher: A pre-Revolutionary bishop, Napoleon’s chaplain, later bishop of Poitiers, then archbishop of Malines and in 1812 Napoleon’s ambassador to Warsaw, Abbé de Pradt (1759–1837) in the preface to his post-Restoration *Histoire de l’Ambassade dans le Grand-Duché de Varsovie* (History of the Embassy to the Grand-Duchy of Warsaw; Paris, 1815) associates Napoleon with the trickster in Molière’s comedy *Les Fourberies de Scapin* (Scapin’s Tricks) by referring to him as a man who appears as ‘une espèce de Jupiter-Scapin qui n’avait pas encore paru sur la scène du monde’ (‘a kind of Jupiter-Scapin never before seen on the world stage’).

#### Monsieur de Martainville:
Donougher: A playwright and journalist of no great distinction, Alphonse Martainville (1776–1830) in 1819 founded the ultra-conservative newspaper *Le Drapeau Blanc*.

Madden: a royalist playwright and actor (1776–1830) who is best remembered as the founder of the Ultra newspaper *Le Drapeau blanc*.

#### Fiévée:
Donougher: A journalist of ultra-royalist opinions, Joseph Fiévée (1767–1839) was also the author of a very successful novel of royalist sentiment, *La Dot de Suzette* (Suzette’s Dowry), adapted for the stage within months of publication (1798).

Madden: Joseph Fiévée was a journalist who tacked his sails to the prevailing wind, switching from Bonapartism to royalism in 1815.

#### Monsieur Agier:
Donougher: An ardent ultra-royalist in 1816, François-Marie Agier (1780–1848) gradually moved to a more liberal position, and as vice-president of the Chamber of Deputies in 1828 led a group, regarded as defectors by the ultras, that controlled the majority.

Madden: Agier was the leader of a large faction of conservatives in the Chamber of Deputies.

#### Colnet:
Donougher: The journalist and satirist Charles Colnet du Ravel (1768–1832) was an outspoken critic of Napoleon in the many articles that he wrote for a number of journals, and his bookshop, known as his *caverne*, became a meeting-place for other writers who shared his political opinions.

#### Monsieur le Marquis de Buonaparté:
Donougher: The Jesuit Père Jean-Nicolas Loriquet (1767–1845) was accused of having made this reference to Napoleon in a school textbook that presented an anti-Revolutionary view of French history. There is no evidence that the phrase was ever included in his text, but Loriquet and the Jesuits were discredited as educators as a result of the accusation.

#### doctrinaires:
Donougher: The name by which the political party of constitutional monarchists became known.

#### After the fifth of September … the eighth of July:
Donougher: The Terror was instituted by a decree of 5 September 1793 authorizing the Revolutionary government to eliminate its enemies.

Donougher: The restoration of the Bourbon monarchy dates from 8 July 1815 when Louis XVIII made his entry into Paris.

Madden: an apparent reference to a decree of the Convention on September 5, 1793, which authorized the arrest of “suspects” practically on the whim of Revolutionary authorities, making noble status a virtual crime in itself. July 8, 1815, was the day Louis XVIII returned to Paris after Waterloo. In terms of both numbers and official persecutions, it is a gross exaggeration to compare the *Terreur blanche* to the *Terreur rouge* of 1793–94.

#### Monsieur de Vaublanc:
Donougher: Vaublanc, who had been a well rewarded supporter of Napoleon, enthusiastically welcomed the return of the monarchy and was appointed minister of the interior in September 1815.

Madden: minister of the interior to Louis XVIII.

#### Bouvines:
Donougher: Philippe II (1165–1223) won a decisive victory for France at the battle of Bouvines in 1214.

#### The Congregation:
Donougher: A religious association for clergy and laity; revived in 1814 by the Jesuit Pierre Ronsin (1771–1846) for the defence of Catholicism, the Congregation came to be closely allied with the royalist cause and politically influential.

Madden: The Chevaliers de la Foi, or Knights of Faith, a mostly aristocratic group committed first to the Church and second to politics, became an almost mythical force in the popular political imagination under the Restoration. The Congregation plays a large role in Stendhal’s *Le Rouge et le noir*—far larger, probably, than it ever played in fact.

### 3.3.4: End of the Brigand
No footnotes

### 3.3.5: The Utility of Going to Mass, in Order to Become a Revolutionist
No footnotes

### 3.3.6: The Consequences of Having Met a Warden

#### the *Moniteur:*
Madden: the quasi-official newspaper of virtually every French government from 1789 to 1901. Bonaparte was especially conscious of the usefulness of such an outlet.

#### the *Mémorial de Sainte-Hélène:*
Donougher: A journal published in 1823 concerning the private life and conversations of Napoleon as recorded by Emmanuel, Comte de las Cases (1766–1842), who accompanied Napoleon to St Helena and remained there with him until 1816. Las Cases wrote, under the pseudonym Lesage, a historical atlas first published in England in 1801.

Madden: Emmanuel de Las Cases served as an officer in the Napoleonic armies before following Napoléon to Saint Helena. Although ordered by the British to leave after a year, Las Cases had sufficient time to interview Napoléon and gather the notes he would use in composing the *Mémorial*, a hagiographic account of the Napoleonic epic. A huge success from the moment of its publication, the *Mémorial* was one of the most important factors in shaping Napoléon’s legend in the 1820s.

#### the bulletins of the Grande Armée:
Madden: The bulletins were official accounts of the actions of Napoléon’s army. A key tool of imperial propaganda, the bulletins were sometimes praised for their writing; Hugo’s “Homeric stanzas” more likely refers to the content than the style. The bulletins were recognized as propaganda at the time; the saying “to lie like the bulletins” became common among soldiers.

#### Mirabeau … Danton:
Madden: some of the greatest figures of the Revolution. Mirabeau (1749–91) was the famous orator who dominated the Constituent Assembly. Pierre Vergniaud (1753–93) was one of the leading figures of the Girondist faction, moderate republicans who were eclipsed by the more radical Jacobins. Vergniaud was among those executed after the Jacobins triumphed in the spring of 1793. On Saint-Just, see here. Robespierre, the leader of the Jacobins, was overthrown in the coup of 9 Thermidor, July 28, 1794. On Desmoulins, see here. On Danton, see here.

#### Vergniaud:
Donougher: A brilliant defence lawyer who became leader of the moderate Republican Girondist faction, Pierre Vergniaud (1753–93) was the last of the twenty-one Girondists to be guillotined in October 1793.

#### his own sisters’ lover:
Donougher: A defamatory rumour that circulated among anti-Bonapartists.

Madden: such was the royalist propaganda against Napoléon, that he and his brothers committed incest with their sisters.

#### the [charlatan/ham actor] who took lessons from Talma:
Donougher: Napoleon took a great interest in the theatre and was a particular admirer of the actor Talma, reportedly offering him advice on how men of power in the great tragedies should move on stage. The rumour that Napoleon was taking lessons in deportment from Talma is reflected in a cartoon of 1814 in which Napoleon is caricatured aping poses struck by the tragedian.

Madden: “ham actor” refers to the rumours that Napoléon had been taught how to perform in public by the actor Talma (see here).

#### poisoner of Jaffa:
Donougher: Contemporary rumours, much disputed, had it that when Napoleon withdrew from Jaffa in 1799 after the abortive Syrian campaign, he gave the order that wounded and plague-infected French troops should be administered fatal overdoses of opium, an allegation for which Walter Scott in his *Life of Napoleon Buonaparte* (1827) found ‘insufficient evidence’.

Madden: The legend of the “poisoner of Jaffa” refers to the Egyptian campaign of 1798–99. Napoléon supposedly poisoned the well at a camp in Jaffa (Haifa) in order to eliminate sick soldiers who were slowing his retreat after encountering an overwhelming Turkish force.

#### Charlemagne … the Committee of Public Safety:
Madden: some of the most powerful rulers of France. Charlemagne (ca. 750–814), the first Holy Roman emperor, is claimed by the French as a king. Louis XI (born 1423, reigned 1461–83), the Spider King, patiently and ruthlessly consolidated royal power in the wake of the Hundred Years’ War. Hugo helped promote the legend of Louis XI in *Notre-Dame de Paris*. Henri IV was the first Bourbon king and the grandfather of Louis XIV (born 1638, reigned 1643–1715). Cardinal de Richelieu (1585–1642), the loyal and ruthless prime minister of Louis XIII, worked to strengthen the monarchy. The Committee of Public Safety was the executive component of the Convention, the means through which Robespierre ruled the country.

#### *Baron Marius Pontmercy:*
Madden: Like Marius, it was only after his father’s death in 1829 that Hugo began to use the title of “Baron Hugo,” to which he was entitled according to the strict rules of the imperial nobility, his elder brothers being the comte (Abel) and vicomte (Edmond) Hugo.

#### Géronte’s gaiety:
Donougher: The stock character of the old man in the comic tradition, as represented for instance in Molière’s *Le Médecin Malgré Lui* (1666) or *Les Fourberies de Scapin* (1671).

Madden: The name Géronte was traditionally used for the character of the patriarch in French theatre, including by Molière.

#### the melancholy Werther:
Donougher: An allusion to the Romantic hero of Goethe’s confessional novel *The Sorrows of Young Werther* (1774).

Madden: Werther was the classic Romantic hero of Goethe’s *The Sorrows of Young Werther*, a brooding youth in love with an unattainable woman.

### 3.3.7: Some Petticoat

#### a good-looking officer:
Madden: With his moustache, his “girl’s waist,” and his decorative sabre, Lieutenant Théodule is a classic dandy of the era.

#### on top:
Madden: The cheapest seats on a public coach were those on the top deck, the roof of the carriage itself, which had no protection from the elements.

#### Théodule:
Madden: Théodule, which can suggest “one who praises God,” is a name well suited to please Mademoiselle Gillenormand, even if the young officer would prefer the more fashionable “Alfred.”

#### Argus snored all night:
Donougher: The hundred-eyed giant, whom the jealous goddess Juno appoints to guard her rival in love Io (see note p. 1375 on *Io … Pissevache*), is lulled to sleep by Mercury and then beheaded in order to release Jupiter’s paramour from his watchfulness (Ovid, *Metamorphoses*, bk I, lines 622–722).

Madden: Argus was the hundred-eyed, all-seeing demigod of Greek mythology.

### 3.3.8: Marble Against Granite

#### rogues, cutthroats, red caps, thieves:
Madden: the royalists’ image of the revolutionaries; on red caps, [see here](#notes_001.html#p1b1ch10en21).

#### Louis XVIII had been dead four years:
Madden: Louis XVIII died in 1824.

#### the duc de Berry:
Madden: the royalist martyr assassinated in 1820; [see here](#notes_001.html#p1b3ch1en35).

#### sixty pistoles:
Madden: a coin worth ten livres, or francs. The word was rarely used in the nineteenth century.

### 3.4.1: A Group Which Barely Missed Becoming Historic

#### Tugenbund:
Donougher: A Prussian nationalist movement founded in Königsberg in 1808, the Tugenbund (literally, ‘league of virtue’) was declared illegal in 1809 but continued to operate as a secret society.

Madden: The Tugendbund (League of Virtue) was formed in 1808 as a response to the French domination of Germany. Its members sought to promote German nationalism and to fight Napoléon.

#### Italian carbonarism:
Donougher: The Carbonari (literally, ‘charcoal-burners’, the forest-dwelling artisans from whom the movement took its inspiration) were members of secret revolutionary nationalist societies originating in the Kingdom of Naples and Sicily in the early nineteenth century, later spreading to France.

Madden: The Italian Carbonari also formed as a resistance movement in response to the rule of Joachim Murat around 1810. Carbonari groups formed in different parts of Italy, demanding greater liberalism and—in the north—combating Austrian influence. In Savoy and Naples, Carbonari succeeded in forcing the monarchs to grant constitutions. Ironically, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte was a member of the Carbonari before becoming heir to his uncle’s throne and Hugo’s nemesis.

#### Cougourde:
Donougher: An association of liberals that arose in Aix-en-Provence and spread to other parts of France, but was short-lived. The name means ‘gourd’.

Madden: The Cougourde, a secret organization of republicans, had only begun to form under the July Monarchy; like their fictional contemporaries in the Friends of the ABC, they were “at the embryo stage.”

#### Friends of the ABC:
Donougher: In French, pronounced ‘Ah-beh-seh’.

#### _abaissé_:
Donougher: Also pronounced ‘Ah-beh-seh’, and meaning ‘one brought low’.

#### _Castratus ad castra_ that made an army general of Narses:
Donougher: The Byzantine general Narses (*c.*480–574) was a eunuch, a *castratus*, who became a military leader (*ad castrum* meaning literally, ‘to the army camp’), under the emperor Justinian, conquering the Ostrogoth kingdom in Italy for Byzantium.

Madden: “From castrato to the camp.” The eunuch Narses was made a general by the Byzantine emperor Justinian.

#### _Barbari et Barberini_:
Donougher: An allusion to the saying *Quod non fecerunt barbari, fecerunt Barberini* (‘What the barbarians did not do, the Barberini did’), referring to Urban VIII, Maffeo Barberini (1568–1644), who is supposed to have plundered the Pantheon for the bronze needed for the baldachin that he commissioned Bernini to create for the basilica of St Peter.

Madden: “What the barbarians didn’t take, the Barbarini will”; in the seventeenth century, the aristocratic Roman Barbarini family appropriated a number of antiquities for their palace.

#### _Fueros y Fuegos_:
Donougher: Spanish: Literally, ‘Charters’ (guaranteeing local rights and privileges) ‘and Fires’.

Madden: “Rights and hearths!” was the motto of Spanish liberals in the revolt of 1823.

#### _Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram_:
Donougher: ‘Thou art Peter \[*Petrus*\], and upon this rock \[*petra*\] I will build my church’, Matthew 16:18.

Madden: *Tu es Petrus … hanc Petrum:* Jesus’ words to Peter: “You are Peter and on this rock I shall build my Church” (see here).

#### Les Halles … Café Musain:
Madden: The great Halles of Paris were still the site of the central market. Corinthe was one of the independent city-states of ancient Greece. The place Saint-Michel was not the modern square on the left bank of the Seine but on the site of today’s place Edmond Rostand, just outside the Luxembourg gardens.

#### the main ones:
Madden: The nine Friends of the ABC are generally seen as reflections of different aspects of Victor Hugo.

#### Antinous:
Donougher: Of renowned beauty, Antinous (*c.*111–30) was the favourite of the Roman emperor Hadrian (76–138). After the youth, believed to have been his lover, died, Hadrian deified him, and his image abounded in statuary and on coins.

Madden: The lover of the Roman emperor Hadrian, Antinous is one of the classic images of male beauty from antiquity.

#### Gracchus … Saint-Just:
Madden: The Gracchi were two brothers who served as tribunes in Rome; both sought to reform land ownership in favour of the poor, and both were persecuted by the patrician class. The youthful Saint-Just (see here) was a leader of the Revolution who was executed before his thirtieth birthday.

#### Evadne:
Donougher: The daughter of Poseidon by the nymph Pitane, Evadne was loved by the god Phoebus, by whom she bore a son, Iamos. Evadne was also the name of the wife who, for love of her husband Capaneus, threw herself on his funeral pyre.

#### Aristogeiton … Harmodius:
Donougher: The story of the homosexual couple Aristogeiton and Harmodius who overthrew a tyrant (they are also known as the Tyrannicides) is one of the founding myths of Athenian democracy explored in Thucydides’ *History of the Peloponnesian War* (bk VI, chs 54–9).

#### Evadné’s bare breast … Harmodius:
Madden: Hugo seems to have confused his allusions here. Evadné was a beautiful young woman loved by Apollo who rejected the god in favour of the warrior Capane; when Capane was killed in battle, Evadné threw herself on his funeral pyre. Harmodius and Aristogeiton hid their daggers in flowers during a procession in order to take revenge on Hipparch, who had seduced the sister of Harmodius.

#### Ezekiel’s awesome cherub:
Donougher: As described in the Book of Ezekiel, chs 1 and 10.

Madden: The “awesome cherubim” in the Old Testament Book of Ezekiel are fierce and unearthly creatures who guard the heavens.

#### Beaumarchais’s gallant Cherubino:
Donougher: The charming young page in *The Marriage of Figaro* who is in love with the Countess Rosina.

Madden: Cherubino is a charming, Puck-like character, a boy traditionally played by a young woman, in Beaumarchais’ *Marriage of Figaro*.

#### *Homo et Vir:*
Madden: two Latin words for “man.” *Vir* connotes the traditional masculine, or virile, qualities of the Roman citizen.

#### Arago:
Donougher: Physicist and astronomer, Dominique-François Arago (1786–1853) was director of the Paris Observatory.

Madden: Dominique-François Arago (1786–1853) was a pioneering physicist and astronomer, director of the Paris Observatory.

#### Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire:
Donougher: At the age of only twenty-one, the naturalist Saint-Hilaire (1772–1844) was appointed professor of zoology at the Musée National d’Histoire Naturelle, and in 1809 he became professor of zoology at the University of Paris. He wrote *Philosophie Anatomique* (1818–22).

Madden: Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772–1844) taught zoology at the University of Paris.

#### Saint-Simon with Fourier:
Madden: see here and here

#### Puységur and Deleuze:
Donougher: Jacques de Chastenet, Marquis de Puységur (1752–1825), was a disciple of Mesmer who conducted research into hypnotic trances, what he called ‘artificial somnambulism’. The naturalist François Deleuze (1755–1835), who became librarian of the Musée National d’Histoire Naturelle, was also an advocate of the theory of animal magnetism.

Madden: two proponents of magnetism; followers of Mesmer.

#### issues of education:
Madden: Hugo was a constant advocate of education reform throughout his life.

#### Montfaucon’s lake:
Donougher: Montfaucon was for centuries the site of a gallows where executed criminals were left to hang until their bodies decomposed. It was also an area of gypsum and lime quarries, which, when exhausted, were used for dumping rubbish, including waste from the nearby slaughterhouses, and thousands of square yards were filled with stinking lakes of human excrement that eventually produced fertilizer.

#### *André Chénier*:
Donougher: The poet Chénier (1762–94), who initially welcomed the Revolution, was an outspoken critic of its excesses – in 1793 he wrote an ‘Ode to Marie-Anne-Charlotte Corday’, Marat’s assassin. Arrested in March 1794, and held in St-Lazare prison, he was executed on 25 July 1794 (7 Thermidor year II), only a few days before the fall of Robespierre and the end of the Terror.

Madden: a royalist journalist who was arrested and executed in 1794; his Romantic poetry was not published until 1819, after which he became a hero to Hugo’s generation.

#### preferred Corneille to Racine:
Madden: Hugo also preferred Corneille to Racine.

#### *Agrippa d’Aubigné*:
Donougher: The poet Théodore Agrippa d’Aubigné (1552–1630) was also a man of action, who fought with the Protestant army in the Wars of Religion. In 1620 his religious position eventually obliged him to leave France and take refuge in Geneva. Françoise d’Aubigné (1635–1719), the future Madame de Maintenon, mistress and then wife of Louis XIV, was his granddaughter.

Madden: Agrippa d’Aubigné (1552–1630) was a Huguenot poet who drew on his knowledge of the Bible to compose poetic laments on France torn apart by the Wars of Religion.

#### Greece … Italy:
Madden: five European nations viewed as oppressed by foreigners: the Greeks and Romanians by the Ottoman Empire; the Poles by Russia; Hungary and Italy by the Austrian Hapsburgs.

#### 1772:
Madden: the first of three partitions of Poland in the eighteenth century by Russia, Prussia, and Austria (“that crime of three”). Upon the third partition, in 1795, Poland ceased to exist. At the Congress of Vienna, Czar Alexander I declared that a free Poland was a mortal threat to Russia and essentially annexed the country. Hugo called for a free Poland in one of his first speeches before the Chamber of Peers, in 1846.

#### _ne varietur_:
Donougher: Latin, meaning ‘not to be altered’, used on notarized legal documents.

Madden: “without exception.”

#### One of the false ideas … that particle:
Madden: The “nobiliary particle” was not as insignificant as Hugo claims, but it was far more important after the Revolution than before and probably more important to the bourgeoisie than to the aristocracy.

#### the *Minerve:*
Madden: a conservative newspaper.

#### *Chauvelin … Caumartin*:
Donougher: An aristocrat who embraced the Revolution, Bernard-François, Marquis de Chauvelin (1766–1832), was elected under the Restoration as a deputy who voted with the extreme left. Imprisoned for several months during the Terror, Jacques Caumartin (1769–1825) served as a liberal deputy 1817–23.

#### _quasi cursores_:
Donougher: An allusion to a line from *De Rerum Natura* by the first-century-BC poet Lucretius: ‘et quasi cursores vitai lampada tradunt’ (‘and like runners they pass on the torch of life’), bk II, line 79.

Madden: “like runners.”

#### paladin:
Madden: i.e., a champion, a defender.

#### bloody tumult of June 1822 … funeral of the young student Lallemand:
Donougher: In June 1820 parliamentary debate on proposed electoral changes intended to increase conservative representation by means of the ‘double vote’ (only the most highly taxed would be eligible to vote for a second college of deputies at the *département* level) led to disturbances in Paris in which the medical student Nicolas Lallemand (1787–1820) was killed by a royal guard, further heightening tensions and fuelling protests.

Madden: During a demonstration against a new law concerning the voting franchise (in June 1820, not 1822), a young student named Lallemand was shot on the place du Carrousel; his funeral subsequently turned into a thousands-strong rally, with an even larger crowd joining a demonstration afterwards.

#### a square cap:
Madden: i.e., the mortarboard traditionally worn by university students.

#### Monsieur Delvincourt:
Madden: dean of the law school in Paris; see here.

#### Marquis d’Avaray:
Donougher: When Louis XVI’s brother escaped into exile in June 1791, he was escorted by François de Bésiade, Comte d’Avaray (1759–1811), whom he elevated to a dukedom in 1799 on his authority as the future Louis XVIII. Bésiade died without heirs before the restoration of the monarchy, but the title was confirmed in 1817 by Louis XVIII and reverted to his father, the Marquis d’Avaray.

#### L’Aigle … Lesgle … Lesgueules:
Donougher: After Napoleon was proclaimed emperor in 1804 he chose the eagle (*l’aigle*), with its associations with Rome and Charlemagne, as the emblem for the imperial coat of arms. He was himself referred to as *l’Aigle*, and his son was known as *l’Aiglon*, ‘the young eagle’. *L’aigle* and Lesgle are pronounced exactly the same. An animal’s mouth is a *gueule*, and the word is used in various hunting expressions, so the term *les gueules* refers to the hunting dogs.

#### the stage-post office of Meaux:
Donougher: Meaux suggests itself as an appropriate post to give him because *l’aigle de Meaux* was already a familiar designation by which the great churchman Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet, bishop of Meaux, was known (which is why Lègle de Meaux is called Bossuet by his young Revolutionary comrades).

#### Bossuet:
Madden: seventeenth-century theologian and orator; see here.

#### the *malade imaginaire:*
Madden: i.e., the hypochondriac, from the title of one of Molière’s masterpieces.

#### four Ls:
Donougher: Pronounced *ailes*, meaning ‘wings’.

#### *feuillants*, royalists, doctrinaires:
Madden: some of the different factions of the French Revolution. The *feuillants* were moderate royalists who split from the Jacobins; they were close in ideology to the *doctrinaires*, who believed in a constitutional monarchy.

#### R:
Donougher: Capital R, *grand R*, pronounced ‘Grantaire’.

#### Loizerolles:
Donougher: The lawyer Jean-Simon Aved de Loizerolles (1733–94), imprisoned during the Terror with his son the poet François-Simon (1771–1845), presented himself when his son was called to face execution, and it was he who went to the guillotine on 26 July 1794, the day before the fall of Robespierre. (It was later established that it was the father, not the son – he had been misidentified because of a copyist’s error – who had been accused of taking part in the Conspiracy of the Prisons, and therefore condemned to be executed.)

Madden: According to a royalist legend, the aristocratic Loizerolles took the place of his son in a Revolutionary prison and was guillotined.

#### the younger Robespierre:
Donougher: When the Convention turned against Robespierre and he was arrested on 9 Thermidor year II (27 July 1794), Augustin Robespierre (1763–94) insisted on joining him, and the two brothers were executed the following day.

#### ‘I loves the girls and I loves good wine’:
Donougher: Two lines from a song called ‘Vive Henri IV’ (‘Long Live Henri IV’) from the three-act comedy *La Partie de Chasse de Henri* IV (Henri IV’s Hunting Party) by the dramatist and librettist Charles Collé (1709–83).

#### Pollux, Patroclus, Nisus, Eudamidas, Hephaestion, Pechméja:
Donougher: Castor and Pollux are the heavenly twins of Greek and Roman mythology. An important theme in Homer’s *Iliad* is the friendship between Achilles and Patroclus, who is killed in battle by Hector (bk XVI). In the *Aeneid* (bk IX, lines 176–446) Virgil tells of the dangerous mission that the Trojan warriors Nisus and Euryalus embark on to find Aeneas, and how, rather than make good his escape alone, Nisus chooses to die with his friend Euryalus at the hands of their enemies (a theme revisited by Byron). The story of Eudamidas, told by Lucian of Samasota (second century AD), cited by Montaigne in his essay *On Friendship* and depicted in a painting by Poussin that was much admired in the eighteenth century, is that of a man who, being poor, bequeaths in his will to his two friends Aretheus and Charixenus the legacy of taking care of his elderly mother and unmarried daughter. When Alexander the Great’s closest friend and companion from childhood Hephaestion died of a fever, classical sources tell us, Alexander was inconsolable. Jean de Pechméja (1741–85), author of *Télephe*, a classically inspired Utopian novel published in 1784, was a childhood friend of Léon Dubreuil (1743–85), doctor to the Marquis de Noailles’s household, who fell ill with a contagious disease and asked that only Pechméja should tend him. They died within a few weeks of each other, their mutual devotion hailed by contemporaries as a model of friendship.

Madden: a reference to some legendary male friendships. Pollux with Castor, Patroclus with Achilles, Nisus with Euryale (in The *Iliad*), Eudamidas was the friend of Charixane in the work of the Roman poet Lucian. The modern example is Jean de Pechméja (1741–85), who was so devoted to his friend Dr. Dubrueil that he cared for the doctor through a fatal and contagious illness and died two weeks after the doctor did.

#### Orestes and Pylades:
Donougher: Another classical couple whose friendship, as represented in Aeschylus’ *Oresteia* and in plays by Euripides, has become proverbial.

Madden: Orestes, son of Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, was raised with Pylades, the son of a foreign king. When Orestes returned to his homeland to avenge his father’s murder at the hands of his wife and her lover, Pylades encouraged his friend not to falter in avenging his father by killing his mother.
