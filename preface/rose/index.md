title: Julie Rose's Translation Preface
---
*Les Misérables* is not just a novel; it is a monument. As a piece of French *patrimoine*, it is as sacred in France as the "Marseillaise" and the notion of the Republic. It is a piece of world treasure, too, a projectile of the imagination, sacred to its readers everywhere as it soars over the rocky landscape of the modern world. Translating it has not been remotely like any other experience I've ever had, for if it's true, as the saying goes, that you do not emerge from reading *Les Misérables* the same person, this is even truer of translating it. You are, for one thing, less inclined to take life lightly—or lying down.

Since I first sat down to work on this translation seasons have come and gone, some days bitterly cold, some days too hot to sit there, in my study, tapping away, without a fan. At one stage I had to wheel in an occupational therapist to reorganize the desk and lighting and come up with a more ergonomic chair; my hair didn't quite go white with the struggle, like Jean Valjean's does when he gives himself up to save another man's skin, but grey hairs appeared and accumulated with building speed and towards the end I needed stronger reading glasses—for you don't tackle a monument with impunity.

Hugo, it seems, wrote standing up, not something my occupational therapist thought of. He wrote *Les Misérables* standing in the room he'd nicknamed "the lookout" at the top of Hauteville House, on the isle of Guernsey, looking out over the water beyond St. Peter Port. When he wasn't upstairs writing, or producing spectacular artworks way ahead of their time, he was downstairs entertaining visitors, enjoying family, or somewhere else in the house doing things with the maid. And when he wasn't in the house, he was either down the road at his intimate friend Juliette Drouet's, or out walking for mile after mile with one of his
beloved dogs—Chougna, Ponto, or Sénat (Senate). Hugo, too, was a monument, a man of huge appetite and lust for life.

Keeping pace with this monumental man is a very physical challenge. For though some parts of *Les Misérables* are more compelling than others, Hugo's energy never seems to flag. His interest in, his passion for, the real world, and the world beyond, beneath, and behind it, are indefatigable. I often thought of him, Victor Hugo, already a monument in his own lifetime, as I set out with my beloved dog, Poppy, heading for her favourite haunts along the Parramatta River. If all translators should have dogs, this is axiomatic when it comes to translators of Hugo.

Hugo once claimed that he'd had two great affairs in his life: Paris and the ocean. As I walked, I thought of that generous, gregarious yet wild man in self-imposed exile on a tiny island in the English Channel, cut off from his beloved Paris but in full possession of his other great love, the sea. And the connection with the oceanic quality of the novel, which is a book about everything, not merely a narrative, seemed obvious. So, too, did the connection with the level of detail and the loving specificity throughout the book.

There is Hugo, tramping over grass and rocks and along the shore, in the bracing salt sea air, taking in the briny tang in great gulps, *remembering* Paris in as much detail as his phenomenal memory—or powers of invention—would allow, as though he was trying to bring back a face he loved (his mother's face, he says) from out of the mists of time.

God is in the details, as we know. Hugo wrote from an omniscient narrator's point of view with an eagle eye for detail—at a time when details of every stripe were being swept away. That turbulent century saw the sudden speeding up of History, the installation of change as a new mode of being—political, social, physical change.

Hugo bears witness to that process of change, to all the changes he had lived through. He describes everything he remembers—fixes forever—times, events, things, people, "facts," standing on the seashore, facing the tidal wave of History, as though standing on shifting sands. He *was* standing on shifting sands.

That is whole point of detail. And if I seem to be hammering the point, it's because I have taken great care to give you, the reader, all of the detail that Hugo wanted you to read. I am, to my knowledge, one of the few translators to have rendered all of Hugo's magnificent novel without censorship.

For there is a whole censorious tradition of translating *Les Misérables*. In this tradition, Hugo's great, original, exuberantly wordy book is "cleaned up." It's cleaned up of rude words and vulgar images, which the translator views as offensive and unnecessary, as though Hugo's use of such words and images was accidental or abhorrent. This is not merely losing bite and punch. Much more seriously, it's misreading the entire book. For if *Les Misérables* can be reduced to a meaning, it is surely the connection Hugo is forever making between the sewer and society, the gutter and the stars.

Offensive matter is not the only thing this tradition has cleaned out of existence. It has also gone after mixed metaphors, grammatical improprieties, and, above all, detail, even where that detail is inoffensive.

We lose the vibrant density of what Hugo was writing about as a result. When Hugo says Cosette was married in "Binche guipure lace," for example, that surely gives us something more than hearing she wore "a lace frock." It tells us where the lace was made, that there was a whole industry of making lace of a very specific kind there, and it tells us what that lace was: guipure. Such a beautiful word. If you don't know what it is, you can always look it up. Hugo's descriptive scope was encyclopedic, and encyclopedias, like dictionaries, still exist, online and off. Knowledge, like virtue, is its own reward.

For some previous translators, *Les Misérables* has been valued solely for its central story and anything that departs from that narrative or doesn't directly advance it is superfluous and *should* go—or be lopped, or banished to an appendix. When you see the book as a narrative—in fact, a detective story-cum-psychological thriller as well as a very moving moral tale—embedded in a much larger work, the impetus behind such a stance seems bizarre. Some of Hugo's finest writing is in the discursive bits and these are tethered to the narrative of moral struggle by many threads, each digression investigating another battlefield, from the military campaign of Waterloo that changed the course of the century, to religious fundamentalism, to the dark battlefield of poverty and crime, and on to the disposal of human effluent, actual and metaphorical.

The digressions don't detract from the narrative, they enhance it. Hugo the orator and polemicist clearly had a good time writing them, just as he had a wonderful time with certain of his characters, who instantly achieved what today we'd call iconic status, entering the language as so many proper nouns and staying there.

The relationship between translator and writer is very like a marriage. In this "marriage," I've wanted to be completely faithful. And I hope the translation is more readable, not less, as a result. I did it in my house in Sydney, Australia, a place put on the modern map by Captain
James Cook, whose *Voyages* Jean Valjean lugs around with him in his little suitcase as one of the few precious things he owns. The house was built in 1869, seven years after *Les Misérables* came out—in ten volumes over nine months, complete with its own advertising
merchandise—to become the biggest hit in the history of publishing. The first owner of the house was a woman named Marie Paull, and she hailed from St. Helier, Jersey. When Hugo docked there in 1855, already a world-renowned celebrity-hero, he was greeted by a crowd of fans. Whether Marie Paull was in the crowd or not we'll never know, but I'd like to think she was. She would certainly have known of Hugo—and the Hugo of the Channel Islands, who conducted séances and talked to the spirits of the dead, would have liked the connection.

The whole effort of this translation has been to respect the work—all of it—and to let it speak, driven by the surprising freshness of Hugo's prose, the muscularity of his rhythms, the vitality of the book's cast and ideas, and the stunning prescience and relevance of a novel once called "the Magna Carta of the human race."

At times it really did feel like I was "channelling" Hugo, and it was every bit as euphoric and draining as such a theatrical experience ought to be. In a sense, all translation is a performance, a piece of theatre. You try to "be" the role you're playing, to stay "in character." This is one way of expressing how I was taken over by this masterpiece in the process of translating it. Censorship is an old tradition in translating—and adaptation. Think of Alexander Pope reinterpreting Shakespeare so primly that it was like a bad translation, with Hamlet thinking of taking up arms against a "siege" of troubles instead of a "sea" of troubles, to avoid the horrors of mixing metaphor. Hugo knew about translating. His son, François-Victor, translated Shakespeare. Yet Hugo claimed translation was censorship. I've done my humble best to
prove him wrong.
