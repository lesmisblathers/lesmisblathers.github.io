<p>"My friend, your sister has made such an impression on me that I love her to the point where my happiness and my very existence are bound up in that sentiment. Give me your opinion; I intend to speak to your parents about it, and so have the goodness to warn them, to beg them to grant me a moment's interview. I think such are the preliminary steps in order to reach your sister; what do you think of them?"</p>
<p>"You are right, my friend; but I will say to my parents only that you wish to speak to them about a matter, and will not tell them what you have to say; for otherwise they would ask me questions, which, if I appeared to know more, would embarrass me, and besides, the more discreet you are, the more grateful will my parents and even Ernestine be to you for such attentions and the refinement of your demeanor. Do not worry; they will hear you, and I wish you the success you desire."</p>
<p>“Do you think they will listen to me with favor?"</p>
<p>"I could not say; but judging by the esteem they have for you, I think you may hope; the results will tell if I guess aright."</p>
<p>We reached my quarters, where I quickly changed my clothes, and on our return we found everything ready, and were soon in the open fields, we on horseback and they in the carriage. I rode a very pretty horse which jumped spiritedly several times, and when he tried to rear, I mastered him with difficulty, drawing a word of praise from Dormeuil. We rode, one on each side of the carriage, and Dormeuil in a very gay mood made us laugh, so that we were all soon in the humor, and agreeable talk and pleasantries were the burden of the conversation. I, in enchantment, could see Ernestine, who laughed at our silly actions and words, for we were spurred on still further by the most beautiful weather imaginable. What a happy day! What delightful moments! All had lately been so for me, and might become even happier. I desired, yet dreaded, the interview I had solicited, which was to take place on our return.</p>
<p>We did not proceed very rapidly, our horses being put at a slow trot so we could chatter at our ease as we rode along. We saw a little town in the distance; Dormeuil's proposal that we make a stop there was approved, and we were not long in reaching it. We got down, watered the horses, and moved over to the banks of the river but a short distance away. My friend took his mother's arm while I remained with M. Dormeuil and Ernestine. We were a little way from each other, and I suspected that Dormeuil would take advantage of the moment to make of his mother the request with which I had charged him. When we came up they were laughing, and Madame Dormeuil looked at me with a certain curiosity. We had to return to Paris, she said, and l imagined that I had something to do with this departure, which was more hurried than had been planned. We retraced our steps and were soon on our way home. The return was more quiet, for each was occupied with his own thoughts.</p>
<p>As we rode along, Dormeuil told me that as soon as we returned, I could speak to his mother, who had questioned him; but he had been reserved, insisting that he was absolutely ignorant of what I had to say. The nearer we approached to Paris, the more uneasy I became, and I looked at Ernestine, saying to myself, "What if I might possess entirely the most perfect thing that nature has formed! Ah, if I can win her, my happiness will exceed my hopes, and I shall have nothing left to live for; my whole life will be too little to insure the happiness of the most beloved of women."</p>
<p>I resolved to steel myself, for I might be refused, even though there was no real objection to me. Dormeuil, who was at my side, said to me: "You seem very preoccupied."</p>
<p>"Are you surprised at that? l am flying in the face of events that, in an hour perhaps, will decide my fate, and I shall be the most unfortunate or the happiest of men."</p>
<p>"Come, courage! A man, above all a soldier, should be ready for anything."</p>
<p>We were entering the city and our talk ceased. We arrived before M. Dormeuil's door, the carriage entered the yard, and we were soon in the parlor.</p>
<p>I noticed Madame Dormeuil leave the room. An instant later a servant came to say that she wished to speak to me, and, on following him, I found myself in her company. She saved me the embarrassment of speaking first, saying to me, smiling: "My son told me you wished to speak to me, M. Edmund. Tell me what I can do for you, and, if I consult only the friendship that you have inspired in me, all will be easy."</p>
<p>Although this beginning encouraged me, I experienced a rising emotion which she did not fail to notice.</p>
<p>"How now, it's really serious, then! You are trembling all over, but calm yourself and speak out. There is nothing in me which should frighten you." I then broached the subject.</p>
<p>"Madame, the way you have received me into your house has been truly flattering, and you have inspired me with respect and gratitude. I could not see her, who, besides yourself, is its chief ornament, without a lively and sincere sentiment. I love Mademoiselle Ernestine, and my happiness would be to tell her so, and to prove it to her. I have deemed it best to speak first to you, to obtain your views; and if they are not unfavorable, I might dare hope one day to be attached to you by the tenderest and most sacred of ties."</p>
<p>"Your request does me honor, M. Edmund, and the straightforwardness and consideration of your actions on this occasion but adds to the good opinion I already had of you. If I have a certain authority over my daughter, it does not go so far as to try to rule her heart. I believe she could not choose better, but before giving you the slightest hope, I must speak to her, as well as to M. Dormeuil, of your intentions. It is saying enough to you that I do not refuse you. Be discreet, and in a few days, sooner perhaps, you will know how the matter stands. Let us return to the others."</p>
<p>I thanked her for her kindnesses.</p>
<p>"Well, now," she went on, "how could I do other than approve of you, my friend?"</p>
<p>"Ah! madame, if it can only be that ere long you may give me another name!"</p>
<p>"I am aware of all the desire you may have for this other name, but patience was never a lover's virtue; come." And we returned to the parlor.</p>
<p>M. Dormeuil was alone, book in hand.</p>
<p>"Where do you two come from?"</p>
<p>"We had something to say to each other."</p>
<p>"All right, I am not curious."</p>
<p>The remainder of the day passed easily, and all that was said was of the greatest interest to me. Ernestine was still charming, but how could I have found her otherwise; each instant showed her more lovable, more attractive in my eyes.</p>
<p>I was forgetting that I should be gone when the striking hour reminded me.I begged them to pardon my indiscretion.</p>
<p>"Oh, there is no harm," said Madame Dormeuil with a very expressive smile.</p>
<p>"What can one do, Madame? Everything here takes me out of myself and holds me. I can well believe I am in my own home, so thoroughly do you seem to forget with pleasure that it is yours. I ask your pardon, a thousand times."</p>
<p>"You are not guilty—tomorrow then."</p>
<p>I left the room and came up with young Dormeuil.</p>
<p>"Well, did you speak to my mother?"</p>
<p>"Yes, nothing is decided yet."</p>
<p>"I imagine."</p>
<p>"If I have no definite hope, at least I did not elicit a refusal."</p>
<p>"I understand that, too."</p>
<p>"I shall have an answer in a few days, perhaps tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Will you come?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, for I am a prey to mortal dreads."</p>
<p>"That does not surprise me. Poor lover, I pity you. Do not come too early, but wait for me. I will come to fetch you, at which time I may, perhaps, be able to tell you some good news. Well, off with you now."</p>
<p>I left him. It would seem that he divined my impatience, for early the next day I saw him coming. He did not give me time to question him.</p>
<p>"My dear Edmund, when I had not even intended coming, they sent me. My mother acquainted father with your re-quest, who approved it, if Ernestine is willing. She was consulted and feels no repugnance, but has not yet given an answer. Your behaviour, however, has flattered her, and she appreciates your having spoken to my mother before making your love known to her. That action has disposed her in your favor. Perhaps it may interest you to know that. But at any rate, come with me right away."</p>
<p>I danced with joy, and ran madly about, or rather, flew.</p>
<p>I was soon at M. Dormeuil's, and when I went in I found him with his wife; Ernestine was in her room, and I was received with pleasant laughter.</p>
<p>"Come, my friend," the father said to me, "you wish to become our son, and we desire it too, because you seem to us worthy of the treasure we would entrust to you, and if she consents, you shall be happy. Your growing love did not escape me, and I have followed it in all its phases and seen with pleasure that it was pure, honest, and delicate." He rang, and a servant appeared.</p>
<p>"Tell my daughter to come down."</p>
<p>A moment later Ernestine appeared, and I rose; the sight of me evidently caused her some emotion, for she blushed.</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle, may I interpret as favorable that flush which does not escape me? I have dared to raise my eyes to yours, to aspire to a happiness beyond my expectation, of which I shall make myself worthy; for the desire to please you makes a man capable of anything. Your parents would perhaps give me their best wishes if you were to join yours to them. Speak, and if you would know what my deportment toward you will be, should you deign to accept my homage, I shall take M. Dormeuil for a model."</p>
<p>Ernestine seemed to wish to speak and yet not to. I seized her hand.</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle, decide my fate."</p>
<p>"Come, daughter," said her father, "I authorize you to answer; but search your heart before doing so."</p>
<p>Ernestine said: "Sir, your choice does me honor, it flatters me, perhaps. Though I do full justice to your good qualities, and your delicate deportment proves that you merit such a distinction, I would like to remind you, that as yet we hardly know each other well enough to make such a momentous decision without reflection. I do indeed believe in the sincerity of your sentiments, of your love; but I cannot tell you yet that I share them. Leave me some time to myself, and since you have the permission of my parents, you can speak to me of your esteem, of…,” she hesitated, and I added, "of your love."</p>
<p>"Leave your happiness to me, for if it depends on my wishes you will soon know."</p>
<p>I took her hand, pressed it to my breast and to my lips. I was fairly drunk, and beside myself with joy.</p>
<p>"Well, well, " said M. Dormeuil, "how foolish lovers are!" And turning to his wife, said "Was I so, darling?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear."</p>
<p>"Then I excuse him. Come, my dear Edmund, and may Ernestine soon make it possible that we may have another son."</p>
<p>Dormeuil came up to me. "My dear friend, " he said, grasping my hand, "may you soon be my brother—that is my dearest wish."</p>
<p>Ernestine was standing near her father, and a sweet security seemed to spread over her whole being.</p>
<p>At last, I was able to say that I made daily progress in her affections, and she soon shared my love. My attentions, my courtesies, and my constancy, convinced her that she was my only love, and the reports they had of me being favorable, at the end of six months I became Ernestine's husband.</p>
<p>I have no words to express my happiness, and every day since that memorable hour I say, "She is mine," and I reproach myself for having the slightest desire of which she is not the whole object. We were in a very heaven of bliss, and since I was staying with the Dormeuils, we were as one family. My Colonel, who had just been made a General, and who had, at the time of my marriage been particularly kind to me, added his requests to the claims which I might have to secure his regiment for me, in which I soon had young Dormeuil, much to the delight of Ernestine and our parents.</p>
