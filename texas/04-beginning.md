## The Heroine of Texas: Beginning

The emigration of a great number of Frenchmen to the United States and the gathering of a group of them on the banks of the Trinity River in the province of Texas, where they proposed to found a colony under the name of Champ d'Asile, aroused considerable interest in their favor. The French who remained in the mother country had seen with sorrow, but with admiration, that friends and brothers, after the storm, were determined to found a new fatherland on another hemisphere. Among the group were those brave men who for twenty-five years astonished the world by their brilliant exploits, now, and as if to obtain additional glory in the eyes of their contemporaries and posterity, thought to civilize a savage country and cultivate a virgin soil. Everyone wished the new colony success and prosperity.

It was with pleasure that the French at home learned that Champ d'Asile was to be founded; and it was with satisfaction, slightly mixed with pride, that they saw about to be demonstrated the saying that, *to Frenchmen, "Everything is possible."* The vindication of this truth flattered the egotism of a nation known for its elevation of soul, its innate love of glory, and its penchant for great deeds. The interest grew when it was known that women had followed the fortunes of the refugees, undeterred by the weakness of their sex. Their strength of character and fortitude held them close to those with whom they had fearlessly cast their lot, hoping to enrich their lives and sweeten their memories and regrets, if perchance they should become homesick for their country. Love and attachments moved some; filial devotion, others; all had a motive worthy of praise and of respect.

So long as the life of the colony was calm and untroubled, while its early happiness was undisturbed, these faithful helpmates of our generous brothers exhibited only those sweet virtues which constitute the charm of domestic life. When hatred and persecutions—cruel daughters of passion—aroused the countries adjacent to Texas, and threatened the expulsion of the colonists from their new fatherland, the French women, so worthy of their high name, gave proof that their courage was equal to that of their husbands, relatives, and friends, and their strength grew in proportion to their need.

It is of one of these women that I am going to tell my readers, and in her I shall show heroism combined with beauty, virtue, and talents, and all the happy, rare, and precious qualities which go to make up the woman whom nature has chosen as a model closest approaching ideal perfection.

Ernestine, Edmund, you whose friend I was, you whose pleasures I have shared—but above all the pain and the dangers—you who gave me so often through example the strength to bear these burdens and to overcome them; you who, so to speak, renewed my being twice over, doubling my fortitude, allow me to devote my pen to the task of tracing the story of your love and constancy. I shall try to excite in the hearts of my readers the emotion you inspire in me. I announce to them that it is Edmund who is going to speak.

He has so often spoken to me of his life in Texas and on Galveston Island, both in the presence of Ernestine and on our excursions beyond the confines of the camp, that after a fashion I shall make use of his own expressions, though I shall not have that fire, that enthusiasm which marked him, which animated his words, his looks, his slightest gesture.
One would have to be in his place, to be consumed, as he was, by that pure true love, which moved his heart and fettered his faculties. When he uttered the name of his beloved, his voice was no longer the same, it took on an expression which startled me, and which I clearly felt, though I cannot describe the emotion it aroused.

I warn my readers that the names of Edmund and Ernestine are not those of the two colonists concerned; for I thought it more seemly to change them. But what I shall have to say is none the less strictly true.
