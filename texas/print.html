<h2 id="the-book-club-of-texas"><a class="header" href="#the-book-club-of-texas">The Book Club of Texas</a></h2>
<p><em>The Story of Champ d'Asile</em> was the seventh, final, and possibly most beautiful selection published by The Book Club of Texas. Despite the fact that publications of the Club were limited to only three hundred copies, the books won widespread acclaim for their design and production. Of the seven selections, three (the 1931, 1932, and 1933 choices) were named among the Fifty Books of the Year—a coveted honor awarded for quality of design, printing, paper, and binding. No other book club can boast such a record of designing and producing beautiful books.</p>
<p>The first selection, in 1930, was <em>Memoir of Colonel Ellis P. Bean</em>, designed and printed in Texas by the Rein Press of Houston. This volume was edited by H. K. Yoakum, whose name appears, by some curious error, as W. P. Yoakum on the title page.</p>
<p>The Club's second selection, <em>Eneas Africanus</em> by Harry Stillwell Edwards, appeared later in 1930. Though published in New York by the Marchbanks Press, it carried the following explanation: "As Mr. Marchbanks is a printer from Texas, The Book Club feels that the book may properly be called a native product."</p>
<p><em>Code Duello</em> (1931), the third selection, designed and printed by the Lakeside Press of Chicago, was chosen as one of the Fifty Books of the Year. Compiled by Virginia Aylett Quitman McNealus, it was a series of previously unpublished letters—relating to a challenge to a duel—that had passed between Senator Sargeant S. Prentiss and Governor I. M. Tucker, both of Mississippi.</p>
<p>Like the third, the fourth publication, <em>Miss Zylphia Gant</em> by William Faulkner (1932), was honored as one of the Fifty Books of the Year. This very fine volume, consisting of a single short story, was designed, printed, and bound in Texas by a Dallas printer, J. M. Colville &amp; Son.</p>
<p>The Club's fifth selection, <em>From Texas to Mexico and the Court of Maximilian in 1865</em> by Judge Alexander Watkins Terrell, was chosen as one of the Fifty Books of the Year for 1934. Designed and printed by the Lakeside Press of Chicago, it provided as an extra attraction a previously unpublished drawing by O. Henry.</p>
<p>The sixth selection was not offered until 1936, the centennial anniversary of Texas's independence. J. Frank Dobie's <em>Tales of the Mustang</em> was illustrated by Jerry Bywater and printed by the Rein Company of Houston.</p>
<p>The seventh and last selection of The Book Club of Texas, <em>The Story of Champ d'Asile</em>, was printed in 1937 by the Rydal Press of Santa Fe, New Mexico. It is reproduced here in facsimile as part of Steck-Vaughn's Life and Adventure Series.</p>
<p>In 1941 Stanley Marcus, founder and president of The Book Club of Texas, conveyed the funds in the Club's treasury and its unsold books to the Texas Folklore Society. The Society's minutes for that year state that it was not possible to sell the books at the inventoried price, but that the Society hoped to realize enough to publish a book worthy of the Club's achievement. With this help the Society was enabled to begin the Range Life Series. If the Society had any of the Club's books today, it could readily dispose of them for prices many times greater than those originally listed. A collector fortunate enough to locate a copy of <em>The Story of Champ d'Asile</em> would have to pay about $100 for it; he could not expect to obtain Faulkner's <em>Miss Zylphia Gant</em> for much less than $300, and he would have to go higher for Dobie's <em>Tales of the Mustang</em>, now the rarest of the Club's publications.</p>
<p>Mr. Marcus, prime mover in the establishment of the Club, had the assistance of John A. Lomax in the early stages. In August of 1928 Lomax, then associated with the Republic National Bank of Dallas, wrote to E. W. Winkler, librarian at The University of Texas, for a list of the principal librarians of Texas so that he could invite them to join the prospective organization. Though Lomax signed himself "Treasurer, The Book Club of Texas," the Club was not formally organized until the next year. As Mr. Marcus states ("The Book Club of Texas," <em>News Notes: Bulletin of the Texas Library Association</em>, X [Oct. 1934], 16), the question of a book club of Texas was asked "a small group of bibliophiles" in 1929, and The Book Club of Texas came into being. It was planned to publish at least one book a year on a literary or historical subject and to encourage the graphic arts generally in Texas. The material chosen was to be indigenous and preferably unpublished, and editions were to be limited to 300 copies. A very handsome broadside, printed by the Rein Company of Houston, announced the formation of the Club, stated its purposes and mode of operation, and listed the charter members. Dallas was better represented than any other Texas city, but there were also members from Austin, Houston, Galveston, and San Antonio. H. Y. Benedict, president of The University of Texas, and R. L. Batts, chairman of the board of regents, had enrolled, and so had W. J. Battle of the classics department and Fannie Ratchford of the Wrenn Library. J. Frank Dobie was not a charter member, but he joined shortly after the appearance of the Club's first book.</p>
<p>In republishing a facsimile edition of <em>The Story of Champ d'Asile</em>, Steck-Vaughn Company is rendering a service to students of history and literature and to book lovers. The only materials added to the original are facsimiles of the title page of each of the two original French books on which The Story of Champ d'Asile is based, and a facsimile of the map from Louis François L'Héritier's <em>Le Champ-d'Asile</em> published by Ladvocat in Paris in 1819. The title page of the original edition of <em>L’Héroïne</em> is reproduced on page 28. The title page of the original French edition of <em>Le Texas</em> is reproduced on page 106. The map is reproduced on page 26.</p>
<p>Rather than correct the occasional typographical errors, none of which produces a confusion of sense, the editors thought it best to reproduce the book in its original form. On page 126, for example, the period instead of a comma after "Perrey Point" would cause no difficulty for the reader.</p>
<h2 id="the-book"><a class="header" href="#the-book">The Book</a></h2>
<p>The Story of Champ d'Asile brings together under a new title two books published separately in Paris, both in 1819: <em>Le Texas, ou notice historique sur le champ d’Asile</em> ... by Hartmann and Millard and <em>L'Héroïne du Texas</em> ... by G.. n F.. n. <em>L'Héroïne</em> is a fictionalized derivative of <em>Le Texas</em> with assistance from other accounts of the French exiles in Texas. The title of <em>Le Texas</em> is incorrectly given in Miss Ratchford's Preface.</p>
<p>Donald Joseph, who was teaching French at The University of Texas, made the translation and Miss Ratchford revised it editorially. Though acknowledging that she had introduced many changes, she says that the translation is basically his. She states that <em>L'Héroïne</em> had been "freely amended," but in fact it follows the original rather closely except for the omission of several overly rhetorical passages.</p>
<p>It must have been Miss Ratchford's preference of the literary to the historical that led her to place <em>The Heroine</em> before <em>Texas</em> in the book. She says <em>The Heroine</em> has a strong claim to be considered the first Texas novel, but the characters do not even reach Texas until three-fifths of the book has been narrated. Well over half is given to the courtship of Edmund and Ernestine in France, related in the delicate, genteel manner then in vogue. The author disclaims that his book is a novel; he says his facts are true, though he has changed the names of his hero and heroine. These "facts," as it appears in his Preface, have come from accounts of the exiles published in Paris, which he asserts a right to use. Besides letters by returned exiles in the newspapers, he mentions a work on Texas brought out by the publisher Ladvocat in 1819 and the book by Hartmann and Millard. Ladvocat's title was <em>Le Champ-d'Asile, tableau topographique et historique du Texas</em> and the author has been identified from his initials as Louis François L'Héretier.</p>
<p>Ladvocat was in the field before Hartmann and Millard (see their allusion on page 112), and his book went to a second edition in the year of publication. Hartmann and Millard promised to tell the love story of Edouard and Adrienne, said to be two of the exiles, but they decided not to because such a romantic tale might have caused doubts about the strict truth of their narration and detracted from their avowed purpose of making clear why the colony failed (see their Epilogue). The anonymous author of <em>L'Héroïne du Texas</em> picked up and exploited their lead; he was able to recognize literary opportunity when it beckoned. It was easy for him to construct a novel about young lovers and attach it to the adventures of Napoleonic exiles in a strange land. He was evidently not one of the colonists; if he had been, he would surely have said so in his Preface.</p>
<p>Comparison of the French and English texts indicates that not every departure from <em>L'Héroïne</em> can be considered an emendation. When Edmund keeps looking for Ernestine everywhere and at the same time tries to conceal his feelings from her brother, the French reads thus: "Je la cherchais sans cesse. J'aurais voulu commander à mes désires, à mes regards, à mon impatience" (p. 28). The English combines the sentences and implies an erroneous connection: "I sought her out ceaselessly, wishing to secure command of my desire, my glance, and my impatience" (pp. 44-45). The contrast and the conditional idea have been lost; it would have been better to keep the second sentence separate and render it something like this: "I tried vainly to master my emotions, glances, and impatience."</p>
<p>When Edmund is talking to Ernestine's brother about asking her parents for her hand, the brother assures him that they will hear his proposal. Then Edmund asks (p. 65), without the initial quotation marks, "Do you think they will listen to me with favor?" This is a rendition of "Croyez-vous qu'elle me sera favorable?”—“Do you think she will be favorable to me?" Edmund was wondering what Ernestine's attitude would be. Mr. Joseph might have misread "elles" for "elle," but he could hardly have mistaken the singular for the plural verb. The change must have been editorial.
Immediately afterward an impersonal <em>on</em> is translated as <em>they</em>, so that the pronoun seems to refer specifically to the opinion of Edmund held by Ernestine's parents instead of to that generally held (Testime qu'on a pour vous," p. 56).</p>
<p>"I am flying in the face of events that, in an hour perhaps, will decide my fate … (p. 67) is not a possible translation of "Je cours au-devant des événemens [sic], et dans une heure peut-être ma destinée va tre fixée …” (p. 59). Edmund means simply that he is getting ahead of events, wondering what will be the response to his proposal.</p>
<p>The reader will see at once that the word <em>later</em> in "her father, the later reigning supreme as General' (p. 77) should be <em>latter</em>, but he cannot tell that the passage is a garbling of “… il régnait, en général, une grande union parmi tous les colons" (p. 73). This should have been “… there existed, in general, a complete unity among the colonists."</p>
<p>Now and then the choice of words is unidiomatic or unhappy, as in "his remarks of me to them" (p. 34) or "a supernatural being you looked to my eyes" (p. 37). <em>About</em> should have been used instead of <em>of</em> and <em>appeared</em> instead of <em>looked</em>. On page 94 substitute <em>privation</em> for <em>poverty</em>; on page 96, <em>shelter</em> for <em>cabin</em>; on page 100, "in order not to endanger her life" for "if her health was not to be compromised."</p>
<p>Punctuation is not impeccable. American practice demands a comma after <em>charms</em> and a semicolon after <em>believe</em> in "equal to her charms of which she is neither vain nor proud" (p. 40) and "I spoke of it not badly, I believe, I saw my three traveling companions smile" (p. 44). No quotation marks should have been placed around the central paragraph on page 82; these are not the spoken words of anyone, but simply the narrator's apostrophe to the savior Indian. At the bottom of page 91 add quotation marks at the end of the paragraph purporting to be taken from the official's report.</p>
<p>In <em>The Heroine's</em> version of how the Indian saved the exiles who had eaten what they thought to be an edible plant, it is said that he pressed the juice of the antidote into "un coco pendu à sa ceinture" (p. 82). To conceal the author's mistake of implying that coconuts grew along the Trinity, Mr. Joseph or Miss Ratchford substituted the general term <em>vessel</em> (p. 82) for <em>coco</em>. In her Introduction Miss Ratchford suggests that the poisonous plant was probably poke greens. It is not described in <em>L'Héroïne</em>, but Hartmann and Millard say it resembled lettuce. According to their account, the antidote was another plant, which had to be boiled. In <em>L'Héroïne</em> the antidote is "fruits en grappe" (p. 82), rendered as "bunches of fruit" (p. 82). Miss Ratchford's reconstruction in her Introduction has features from both <em>The Heroine</em> and <em>Texas</em>. At any rate, the Indian behaved exactly as a noble savage should; he produced the antidote at once and brought about a cure, for, as all herb doctors know, near every harmful plant there grows a beneficial plant with the power of counteracting its effects. The settlers of East Texas did not learn the antidote for poke greens from the Indians; instead, they parboiled the greens and poured off the liquid as the first step in preparing them. (See James W. Byrd, "Creeping Ignorance on Poke Sallet," <em>The Sunny Slopes of Long Ago</em> [Dallas, 1966], pp. 157-63.) The plain narrative of a rank-and-file member of the so-called colony, translated by Jack Autrey Dabbs (in "Additional Notes on Champ d'Asile," S<em>outhwestern Historical Quarterly</em>, LIV [1950-51], 347-58), includes the poisoning incident but does not mention the timely arrival of the friendly Indian who knew just what to do.</p>
<p>The author of L'Héroïne speaks of hunting <em>cormorans</em> (p. 100) on Galveston Island for food. The translation has <em>cormorants</em> (p.93); pelicans would have been the nearest thing to cormorants in this locality, but the exiles would hardly have been eating them when game and fish were plentiful. Here the translator does not shield the author as he does in the occurrence of <em>coco</em>. Since <em>L'Héroïne</em> was not based on firsthand knowledge, when the author went beyond his written sources, he was likely to make mistakes.</p>
<p>In <em>Le Texas</em> the situation is different. It is sometimes difficult to find the right English word for an animal or plant mentioned by Hartmann and Millard, but they seem to have some real knowledge of what they were writing about. When they say that the colonists caught mostly <em>coad-fish</em> (p. 62, italicized) in the Trinity River, they could not have meant <em>codfish</em>. They were using this as an English word. Had they confused it with catfish, which to a Frenchman would sound very much like codfish? They had probably fished in other American rivers where catfish were caught. Mr. Joseph wisely carries over the word as <em>coadfish</em> in italics (p. 139) without trying to translate it.</p>
<p>Hartmann and Millard say (p. 125) that three kinds of snakes are numerous in Texas. <em>Le serpen [sic] à sonnettes</em> is the ordinary French designation for rattlesnake and presents no difficulties; <em>le congo</em> means the congo eel, sometimes called the <em>congo snake</em>, and <em>le mangeur d'oeufs</em> would be some kind of egg-eating snake, popularly know as a <em>chicken snake</em>. Mr. Joseph translates the last two names literally—<em>the congo</em> and <em>the egg-eater</em> (p. 176).</p>
<p>Mr. Joseph carries over into his translation some names of Indian tribes (italicized) just as they appear in <em>Le Texas</em> without providing equivalents more familiar to his readers. It would have been helpful to substitute the forms ordinarily used by writers in English, which he could have discovered by consulting the list of variant names in Hodge's Handbook of American Indians. These are equivalents, Hartmann and Millard's form on the left and Hodge's on the right:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Hartmann/Millard</th><th>Hodge</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Alabamos</td><td>Alibamu</td></tr>
<tr><td>Camanches</td><td>Comanche</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chactas</td><td>Choctaw</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cochatis</td><td>Koasati</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dankhaves</td><td>Tonkawa</td></tr>
<tr><td>Karankavès</td><td>Karankawa</td></tr>
<tr><td>Panis</td><td>Pawnee</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tankards</td><td>Tonkawa</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Hodge does not add <em>s</em> to show the plural, though it is now general usage to do so. For many readers <em>Coushatta</em> would be more recognizable than <em>Koasati</em> because of the well-known Alabama-Coushatta reservation in East Texas. The Indian with the timely antidote was said to be a Coushatta.</p>
<p>Joseph and Ratchford's practice for the French <em>Naquidoches</em> is variable. In Texas the word occurs as <em>Naquidoche</em> (p. 132), <em>Nacogdoches</em> (p. 163), and <em>Naquidoches</em> (p. 177), all unitalicized. Hodge spells the name of the Indians without an <em>s</em>, but the town, named for the Indians, is <em>Nacogdoches</em>. Readers will be puzzled by the statement that the colonists had "made several plantings of Naquidoche, which did very well…” (p. 132). A phrase in the original—“de tabac" (p. 43)—was omitted in translation; what was planted was tobacco of the kind raised by the Nacogdoches Indians.</p>
<p>Place-names are very troublesome to a translator when his original deals with newly explored country and antedates the existence of a reliable map. All he can do is to correlate the names as he finds them with the later, accepted names and point out the difficulties whenever correlation is not possible. It is difficult to deal with geographical perplexities without some form of notes, and Joseph and Ratchford have none. They carry over into their text, without comment, the mysterious <em>rivière Barosso</em> of <em>Le Texas</em>, spelled <em>Barosso</em> on page 176 and <em>Baosso</em> on page 177. This is the Brazos. The geography is not very clear, but there is no other large river which “flows into the Gulf of Mexico near Galveston Bay" and which has a name sounding like the Spanish <em>Brazos</em>. L'Héretier uses the form <em>Brassas</em> in <em>Le Champ-d'Asile</em> (p. 64). The map which Ladvocat had made for the book shows a Barroso flowing into Galveston Bay east of the Trinity and joined to it above as if it were another mouth. (Ladvocat's map is reproduced on page 26.)</p>
<p>Ladvocat's map, said to be based on materials obtained from "one of the principal colonists," reflects the hazy conception which the French had of the region in 1819. Besides being incomplete and sketchy, it contains copyist's errors such as <em>Baralaria</em> for <em>Barataria</em> and <em>Careusin</em> for something like <em>Carasiu</em> (<em>Carcassiou</em> in <em>Le Texas</em>, p. 103). Nevertheless, with this inexact map it is possible to follow the overland journey of the colonists from Galveston to New Orleans. For the benefit of their readers Joseph and Ratchford should have used <em>Calcasieu</em> instead of <em>Carcassiou</em> and <em>Mermentau</em> instead of <em>Mermentas</em> (p. 164). They could have supplied modern equivalents for most of the other unfamiliar place-names.</p>
<p>The <em>Toya</em> mentioned in Texas (p. 177) is the <em>Attoyac</em>, despite the geographical inaccuracy of the sentence in which it occurs.</p>
<p>It would hardly be good practice to respell personal names that have been taken over into French, though the reader of Texas may be startled to see the name <em>Waskès</em> attributed to a Spanish colonel (p. 136). The colonel's wife is referred to later as <em>Madame Vasquez</em> (p. 170).</p>
<p><em>Le Texas</em> was subjected to some editorial emendation, though not to so much as <em>L’Héroïne</em>. The apostrophe to women on page 78 of <em>Le Texas</em> was evidently thought to be too mawkish for inclusion, and so it was dropped without indication (p. 150). Nor is it indicated that details about General Rigaud's daughter and son were revised (p. 179) according to handwritten changes appearing in the copy of <em>Le Texas</em> (p. 130) which Joseph was using.</p>
<p><em>Texas</em> contains fewer inexact or erroneous renderings than does <em>The Heroine</em>. At the top of page 108 there is a passage confused in sense and grammar: “… the refuge which you had been pleased to imagine would see the peaceful end of our days which has been but too long and stormy." The French (third page, un-numbered, of dedicatory epistle) is perfectly clear and easily translatable: “… the refuge where you had hoped that our days, too long tempestuous, would run their course in peace." Sometimes the tense is altered and sometimes a cognate in French produces a peculiar expression in English: “…et nous étions forces de convenir que le sexe le plus faible trouvait des forces qui quelque-fois nous abandonnaient" (p. 78) becomes “… and we are forced to admit that the so-called weaker sex possessed a strength which at times abandoned us" (p. 150). Change <em>are</em> to <em>were</em> and <em>abandoned</em> to <em>deserted</em>—and cancel the intrusive <em>so-called</em>. Mr. Joseph preferred to retain the French <em>eau-de-vie</em> instead of using the simple English word <em>brandy</em>, with the result that two typographical errors slipped by the editor, <em>eaude vin</em> (p. 150) <em>and eau de vin</em> (p. 153).</p>
<p>Errors of this kind puzzle the reader for a moment, but he can soon supply the correction. He has no means of correcting the kind of error which occurs on page 168 when two sentences beginning with dates become confused. The Scilly Islands were sighted on the 6th of May, not the 3rd; what happened on the 3rd has dropped out-a meeting with an English corvette (pp. 109-10). This is the only error of fact in <em>Texas</em> for which the translator or editor is responsible, and it is not very significant. More could be said about accuracy and expression in Joseph and Ratchford's <em>Texas</em>, but there is no reason for doing so.</p>
<p>Translators are always open to criticism, particularly in matters of exactness and idiom. The shortcomings of <em>The Story of Champ d’Asile</em> do not seriously impair the value or interest or the book for the general reader.</p>

<p align=center><em>Affectionately inscribed to Mattie Austin Hatcher, one time Archivist of the University of Texas, who first directed my attention to this story</em></p>
<p>The story of Champ d'Asile was brought to my knowledge a number of years ago by Mrs. Mattie Austin Hatcher, Archivist in The University of Texas. In response to my interest, Donald Joseph of the French Department of The University of Texas translated from the French three accounts of the ill-fated colony, hoping to publish them as a triology consisting of an historical narrative, a love story, and a semi-fictitious adventure. The plan came to naught chiefly because of literary faults in the originals, which Mr. Joseph did not feel at liberty to correct.</p>
<p>From this group, <em>L’Heroïne du Texas</em> is now selected and freely emended, as the most interesting for publication, adding, as it does, the charm of a Rousseauan love story to an historical document. It has, moreover, a strong claim to the title, <em>The First Texas Novel</em>.</p>
<p>The editor has made no attempt to relate Champ d'Asile to earlier French activities in Texas. That work is being done by an able scholar. The present volume is offered merely as a good story of a highly romantic and little known episode in Texas history: the futile attempt of a group of French exiles to found a Napoleonic state in the Southwestern wilderness.</p>
<p>Neither the author of the novel nor its hero and heroine have been identified from the available list of Champ d'Asile colonists. Hartmann and Millard, in <em>Le Texas du Notice Historique sur Champ d'Asile</em>, call the lovers Edward and Adrianne. So much does the Hartmann and Millard narrative add to the present story that an abbreviated version of it is given as a supplement or glorified footnote.</p>
<p>No material remains have been discovered to fix the site of Champ d'Asile. Tradition places it in the near vicinity of the present town of Liberty, a name inherited, it is claimed, directly from the French fort.</p>
<p>For help in preparing this brief and simple work thanks are due to Donald Joseph, the real "founder of the feast," for the translation, despite many changes, is basically his; to W.E. Wrather for generous loans of his books on Champ d'Asile and the aquatints here reproduced; and to Joseph O. Naylor for his courteous release of the Introduction which was originally written for <em>The Epic Century</em>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>More than a century ago, and two years before Stephen F. Austin brought his first Anglo-Americans to the Brazos and Colorado Rivers, a Frenchman on the Seine wrote, apropos of a flood of publications hot from the press, "Texas has become a rich field for literature and anyone may exploit it." He might have cited among a host of lesser tillers of the soil the poet Béranger and, a few years later, the novelist Balzac.</p>
<p>The occasion for the outburst was the founding of a colony of Napoleonic exiles on the bank of the Trinity River in the heart of the Texas wilderness. Such a demonstration of the Rousseauan doctrine of return to nature was enough in itself to excite the interest of romantic France: joined to patriotism and national pride it aroused an enthusiasm that swept the nation, expressing itself in public subscription, benefit performances at the theaters, literary productions, and pictorial delineations of imaginary scenes in the far-off colony. The settlement was a New World Utopia which roused exhausted France from the lethargy of Bourbon reaction to a momentary flash of youthful hope.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the episode that so excited the mother country and gave the diplomats of three nations some bad moments, making itself felt even in lonely St. Helena, has failed to find a place in the traditions of the land where it was enacted. Texas people and Texas literature have forgotten that Texas forests, lighted by the campfires of Napoleon's Old Guard, once rang to shouts of "Vive L'Empereur." Anglo-Texans have never sung, "The laurel grows in Champ d'Asile." But for contemporary narratives the incident would be entirely lost. Those who would know the story must seek it, still in the mother tongue of the writers, on closely guarded shelves of collectors and in "rare book rooms" of public libraries.
What to do with the imperial officers was a problem confronting the restored Bourbon government at the end of the Hundred Days. Napoleon had chosen the United States of America as a place of retirement for himself and his family, and might easily have reached that land of refuge but for his indecision of action and his reluctance to accept the appearance of flight. Joseph Bonaparte, ex-King of Spain, was the only member of the family to enter the designated haven, he alone obtaining the passport necessary for leaving France.</p>
<p>The two, Napoleon and Joseph, were together at Rochefort for a number of days before the Emperor "threw himself upon the generosity of the British nation," by surrendering to Captain Maitland of the <em>Bellerophon</em>. In the course of that time Joseph exhausted in vain every persuasion to bring his brother to accept his passport and quarters in the brig <em>Commerce</em> which was to take him to America—the resemblance between the two being close enough to insure success of the exchange. It was not until after the <em>Bellerophon</em> had sailed that Joseph completed arrangements for his own departure for the United States.</p>
<p>The American brig, <em>Charleston</em>, of South Carolina, was chartered for himself and a small party formerly connected with Napoleon's court. They sailed on July 25, 1815, and landed safely at New York on August 28. In America Joseph called himself Count de Surveilliers, though his identity was well known. After creating a small flurry in diplomatic circles by a not very persistent effort to obtain an interview with President Madison, he settled down for a few months in New York before he leased "Landsowne," the Bingham estate on the Schuykill. Finding this too near Philadelphia and lacking the seclusion he sought, he purchased a farm of about two hundred acres, called "Point Breeze," near Bordentown, New Jersey. On this estate, enlarged by successive purchases, he remained until his return to Europe in 1832, "living quietly and unostentatiously the life of a private citizen…” His home was the center of generous hospitality for all French exiles, and many are the stories of his kindness to even the humblest of his fellow countrymen. Around him the faithful rallied, and to him they paid the court once accorded his brother.</p>
<p>The fortunes of Napoleon's followers in France fell into the shifty hands of that master of intrigue, Joseph Fouché, Duke of Otranto. On the second abdication of Napoleon he was elected President of the Provisional Commission, and was retained by Louis XVIII, as Minister of Police, for this disagreeable task. He it was who made up the first proscription list of about one hundred names, many of them his former colleagues, accomplices, and agents. Under the scrutiny of the King and his council the list was reduced to fifty-nine. As each name was confirmed, Fouché, with his usual double-dealing, perhaps this time with the sanction of the King, warned the victim and provided passports and money for escape. Only those who failed to accept the proffered warning were arrested. Among the refugees to America were five who became the leading spirits of the exiles, though their number included hundreds of lower rank, who for one reason and another had found it desirable to leave France: the brothers Lallemand, Charles the elder, who had begged and been refused permission to share Napoleon's exile, and Henri; Marshal Grouchy, with his two sons, Colonels Alphonse and Victor; General Lefebvre-Desnouëttes; and General Rigaud.</p>
<p>Their reception in the United States was in the main kind and sympathetic. Earlier dislike of Napoleon was counterbalanced by the reactionary policy of the restored Bourbons, and the wave of good feeling that swept the country toward the end of Madison's administration tended to replace political animosities with benevolent understanding. There were already in the country, particularly in Philadelphia and Baltimore, a goodly number of French refugees from the Negro insurrection in Santo Domingo of almost a quarter century earlier. These were, for the most part, in moderate circumstances, and they gave their countrymen a warm welcome which included hospitality and financial assistance to such as needed it. Some of the refugees brought considerable means with them, which they shared with the less fortunate. In the course of time, however, dependence became a burden to both donors and recipients. It was to the interest of all that the refugees become self sustaining. The Government was besought to give them homes in a climate similar to that of France, where they might cultivate the most familiar products of their country—the vine and the olive.</p>
<p>A company of the exiles was organized at Philadelphia in December, 1816, and members of their group were sent out to find a suitable situation for a colony. Acting on advice rather than first-hand investigation, they petitioned Congress to grant them a tract on the Tombigbee River, in the Mississippi Territory recently acquired by treaty from the Creek Indians. The request was granted on liberal terms: they were given four contiguous townships, each six miles square, at $2.00 per acre, to be paid over a period of fourteen years. The land was to be divided among two hundred and eighty settlers, no one to hold more than six hundred and forty acres. The society was to select its own agent.</p>
<p>General Charles Lallemand was chosen president of the group, which was variously styled "Society for the Cultivation of the Vine and Olive," "The French Emigrant Society," and "The Tombigbee Association." The first group of settlers, about one hundred and fifty in number, left Philadelphia in December, 1817, and others followed late in April of the next year, taking with them vines and olive trees for planting.</p>
<p>The colony was a failure for the obvious reason that its members were soldiers unable to adapt themselves to civil pursuits. None among them knew anything of agriculture even in their own country, and all were entirely ignorant of conditions in their new homes. The bill of grant had been formulated with particular care to prevent speculation in the designated lands, but it utterly failed of its purpose. Money lenders owned most of the ground before the first of the exiles reached it. The only achievement of the colonists as a group was the laying out of a town called Aigleville, which proved to be outside their boundaries. And a fairly large and pretentious house built by the leader, General Lefebvre-Desnouttës, on his tract of five hundred acres was the only considerable improvement made by an individual. Near by the General built a log "sanctuary," the shrine of a large bronze statue of Napoleon; "around its feet were swords and pistols which Desnouttës had taken in battle, together with beautiful flags, tastefully hung around the walls." Desnouttës' wife was a sister of the famous Parisian banker, La Fitte. From her he received large sums of money for France. It is said that he spent twenty-five thousand dollars in opening and cultivating his farm in Alabama.</p>
<p>By the end of the summer of 1818, the company was broken up, and most of its members back in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>General Charles Lallemand, the president of the company, in all probability, never visited the Tombigbee, for while that settlement was in formation, he was in New Orleans purchasing supplies for his own colony in Texas. His ambitions transcended a mere agricultural colony within the United States. That it included the rehabilitation of the Bonaparte fortunes in Latin America and the rescue of Napoleon from St. Helena was believed by many of his contemporaries. It is certain that those of the Old Guard in America never ceased to hope for Napoleon's escape, and talked of it and planned for it each time they came together. No scheme was too absurd for their consideration. Just as the royal family of Portugal, driven from its throne by the usurpations of Napoleon, fled overseas to the colony of Brazil, so might Joseph Bonaparte, deposed king of Spain, set up his standard in the Spanish colonies of America until the way was open for his return to his European court. Once established on the throne of Mexico, he would rescue his brother.</p>
<p>The scheme was set forth in a letter from London in July, 1816, published in Nile's Register, but denounced as false by the editor of the magazine. In the late summer of 1817, Hyde de Neuville, representative of the restored Bourbon government in Washington, came into possession of a disturbing set of papers apparently written by Lakenal, a proscribed regicide whom Lafayette had introduced to Jefferson as a "Member of the French Institute, Officer of the University, and Inspector-General of the new Metrical System, who abandons those functions and a handsome treatment to become a settler in the State of Kentucky." These papers implied the existence in America of an association under the name of the "Napoleonic Confederacy," conspiring to place Joseph Bonaparte in control of Mexico as King of Spain and the Indies.</p>
<p>The documents, with a note from De Neuville, were laid before President Madison, who instituted the desired investigation. De Neuville also informed Spanish Minister Onis of the plot against the Mexican possessions of the King of Spain, and Onis in his turn laid his complaint before the Secretary of State, hoping that the United States would not violate its treaty of neutrality with European powers by allowing the execution of such a plot within its borders.</p>
<p>An investigation failed to show that Joseph Bonaparte, or the <em>Count de Surveillers</em>, as he was called, had contributed either money or encouragement to the scheme. Lallemand, whose name had been connected with the affair, went to Washington and there obtained an interview with Secretary Adams, in which he denied acquaintance with Lakenal, as well as any knowledge of the alleged plot, the report of which, he surmised, had grown out of the project settlement on the Tombigbee River. The report, however, reached St. Helena by way of England and led to a stricter watch over the imperial prisoner.</p>
<p>On December 17, 1817, a few days after the departure of the Tombigbee colonists from Philadelphia, a second group of exiles under the leadership of General Rigaud, set sail on the schooner <em>Huntress</em> carrying a cargo that accorded strangely with the needs of an agricultural colony. Included were six hundred muskets, four hundred sabres, and twelve thousand pounds of powder. Nicolas Biddle of Philadelphia reported to President Monroe that the vessel carried one hundred and fifty men, chiefly Frenchmen, who had been disciplined and prepared by the Lallemands. It was said, Biddle wrote, that other vessels from other ports would join them at some point, most probably in the Gulf of Mexico. It was said also that the funds for the expedition were raised almost entirely from land given to the officers and men in Alabama, which they sold at $1.00 or $1.50 per acre, chiefly to French people of Philadelphia. In one of the narratives of the expedition it is stated that these supplies were bought "partly with the voluntary contribution of the colonists and partly with a donation of Joseph Bonaparte."</p>
<p>A suspicion occurred to President Monroe, which he expressed to Biddle, that the expedition might in reality have been prompted by Spanish Minister Onis against the United States. Biddle was sure that this was not true, though he thought that the brothers Lallemand might be open to offers from Onis for their services with the Royalists.</p>
<p>The division of the expedition carried by the <em>Huntress</em> was under the command of General Rigaud, who was accompanied by his daughter. The ship sailed south from Philadelphia, rounded the Tortugas, and in the vicinity of New Orleans was visited by an officer of one of Jean Lafitte's independent corsairs from Galveston Island. The meeting was altogether friendly, and the courtesies exchanged on board were continued on shore at Galveston, where the colonists remained for more than a month, waiting for the arrival of General Lallemand with supplies and recruits.</p>
<p>One of the narrators depicts Lafitte's band as a bad lot: "freebooters gathered from among all the nations of the earth and determined to put into practice the traditions of the buccaneers of old. They gave themselves up to the most shameless debauchery and disgusting immorality, and only their chief by his extraordinary strength and indomitable resolution had the slightest control over their wild and savage natures. Thanks to him the pirates became harmless neighbors to the exiles, with whom they often exchanged words of political sympathy, crying amicably, 'Long live Liberty!'"</p>
<p>Lallemand's arrival with additional colonists in early March was hailed with delight; songs of glory were sung, and toasts were drunk to the fatherland and the friends who remained there, and to the good fortune and prosperity of the colony. The recruits showed a motley mingling of French exiles Tombigbee colonists and Santo Dominican refugees Spaniards, Poles, Mexicans, and Americans, with a sprinkling of ex-pirates. The company, now numbering about four hundred members, set out in high spirits for the chosen site on the Trinity River. Boats had been purchased from Lafitte—one narrator says ten, another twenty-four. A storm scattering the craft, most of them had to turn back to Galveston. One was wrecked, drowning five of the six men on board.</p>
<p>After three days of struggle on the water, the party came together at Point Perrey, there they decided to separate: one group of a hundred, led by Generals Lallemand and Rigaud, to continue the journey by land; the rest, under Colonel Charrasin, to bring up the supplies by boat, guided by Indians with whom the colonists had already established friendly relations, "thanks to a few bottles of rum and some knives and muskets." The boats missed the mouth of the river and were six days in reaching the designated site "twenty leagues from the Gulf of Mexico." In the meanwhile the overland party, having taken insufficient food with them, suffered cruelly. In their hunger they ate of a wild plant resembling lettuce (probably poke greens) which they found in the wood—all except Lallemand, Rigaud, and Dr. Mann, the surgeon. An hour after this ill-advised repast, every one who had tasted it, ninety-seven in number, "lay stretched on the ground in awful agony, wracked by the most terrible convulsions." As they lay "pale and undone," an Indian of the "Cochatis nation" appeared. The sight of the sufferers and uneaten portions of the herb told him the story. He disappeared into the forest and shortly returned with bunches of fruit. Pressing the juice from these into a vessel carried at his waist, he gave it to the sufferers to drink. "They soon began to stir and rise as if from a long painful fainting spell."</p>
<p>On the sixth day the land party met the flotilla bearing provisions at the appointed place. They had been four days without food and were in an exhausted condition, but recovered rapidly.</p>
<p>The first concern of the united colonists was the erection of fortifications, followed as soon as possible by the building of private homes for the married men and higher officers.</p>
<p>The settlement was laid out on a circular plan, taking its direction from the four forts. The dwellings were built of trees of medium thickness, cut into lengths of from six to seven feet, driven into the ground close together, and the chinks filled with a mud plaster. Loop-holes were left in the walls, so that each dwelling might be used as a fortress in case of attack.
Their completion was marked by gay house warmings, when the men who built them fêted the mistresses, drinking to Texas, to the Sons of Glory, and to the happiness of the French people.</p>
<p>The settlement was called Champ d'Asile.</p>
<p>From this place General Lallemand issued a manifesto, dated May 11, 1818, in which he announced to the world the establishment of an agricultural colony, claiming "the first right given by God to man—that of settling in this country, clearing it, and using the produce which nature never refuses to the patient laborer"; and disclaiming any warlike intentions, except defense against attack.</p>
<p>The code of laws as drawn up "was founded on justice, friendship, and disinterestedness," the fundamental principle being the obligation of mutual aid and protection. All property was held in common, and all looked "to the same end in making the colony prosper: the general happiness, which would rebound to the individual happiness of each." Lallemand's proclamation made a great noise in Europe, above all, in France, exciting the admiration of the Liberals and the sneers of the opposing party. <em>La Minerve</em>, a fortnightly review of the day opened a subscription list for the exiles which yielded approximately one hundred thousand francs.</p>
<p>Béranger contributed a highly romantic poem to the cause; a pamphlet written by Monsieur Shiritiar and published by Ladrocat, went through two editions; theatrical performances and various other benefits also brought in considerable money, not a cent of which reached the colonists.</p>
<p>The romantic nature of the exiles responded warmly to the natural beauty of their surroundings. The women transplanted flowers and cultivated them with care in gardens near their homes. They were particularly fond of the laurel, a "tree so beloved of the French that one might believe that it was for them alone that nature decorated the earth with it." Its abundance in the Texas woods was taken as a good omen by the exiles, and one of their number, the wife of an officer, composed a song having for its refrain, "The Laurel Grows in Champ d'Asile."</p>
<p>Far from cultivating the soil, the exiles, most of them totally ignorant of agriculture and uninterested in civil pursuits, were finding what diversion they could in military maneuvers after their hours of communal labor. They ate at a common mess, and bivouacked as if they were in an enemy's country, all except the Generals, two or three superior officers, and the women, who had large and not uncomfortable cabins. The few who cultivated gardens were richly rewarded for their efforts.</p>
<p>Besides drilling, the men had hunting, fishing, and athletic games for amusement. To all these diversions the few women and children of the colony lent their presence, commending all efforts and applauding success. The echoes of Texas resounded with songs of love and glory, the favorite on every occasion being "The Laurel Grows in Champ d'Asile."</p>
<p>Around the nightly campfire, kept burning to frighten away wild beasts, the men loved to pretend they were loungers in the arcades of the <em>Palais Royal</em>, enjoying the glories of Imperial victories. Lallemand sometimes joined them, and entertained them with scraps of his last conversations with the Emperor. At such times the wildest dreams took possession of their imaginations, and Texas vanished from their thoughts. "They were eager to serve under the Mexican flag and help that country to throw off the Spanish yoke, after which they could easily persuade the Mexicans to give them a fast sailer, with which they would storm the island of St. Helena, carry off the Emperor in triumph, and crown him ruler of Mexico."</p>
<p>When such amusements as the camp itself could provide began to pall, Lallemand arranged a grand celebration in honor of a treaty made with several tribes of neighboring Indians, at which a deal of rum was distributed, until in a burst of drunken friendliness the Indians adopted Lallemand as a great chief and invested him "with the appropriate insignia of his new honors."</p>
<p>But nothing could stay the catastrophe inherent in the situation. Just as the expedition was setting out General Lallemand had issued a proclamation, a copy of which he claimed to have sent Ferdinand VII of Spain, arrogantly announcing his intention to make a settlement in Texas whether it pleased the Spanish court or no.</p>
<p>No one should have been surprised when friendly Indians brought information that a Spanish army was on its way from San Antonio to expel the French as hostile intruders. Prudence prevailed, and the colonists decided to withdraw, rather than to fight. Their departure was saddened by the slaying of two of their number by Indians. The partially devoured, still quivering bodies, were recovered and given burial. Dropping a laurel branch in their graves was the final pageant of Champ d'Asile.</p>
<p>There were enough boats at hand to take the company as far as Galveston, where they again established themselves as neighbors to the pirates. There scurvy, dysentery, and fever broke out, aggravated by lack of medicine and scarcity of food, and again they were at the mercy of the outlaws who drove hard bargains for all they sold.</p>
<p>The United States since the purchase of Louisiana 1803 had maintained a more or less definitely asserted claim to Texas, growing out of the vagueness of the Louisiana boundary as defined in the several treaties between France and Spain before the United States acquired Louisiana. The Spanish Minister Onis could not, without admitting this claim, protest to the government of the United States against the landing of the Napoleonic refugees at Galveston, but he did complain to President Adams of the apparent violation of neutrality in allowing the <em>Huntress</em> to be armed and equipped, as he claimed, in an American port.</p>
<p>Adams, without answering Onis' note, sent George Graham, chief clerk and acting Secretary of War during the last two years of Madison's administration, to Galveston to find out what Lallemand's expedition amounted to. Graham met the refugees from Champ d'Asile on Galveston Island, and he must have smiled sadly to himself at the Spanish Minister's fear of this pathetic group. When he departed, after consultation with Lallemand, the General-in-Chief and his staff went with him as far as New Orleans for the purpose of securing relief for his colonists.</p>
<p>In Lallemand's absence Rigaud assumed command of the disheartened and almost desperate company. The pinch of hunger grew more desperate every day. Many were saved from starvation only by the generosity of Lafitte. To add to the situation, an agent of the Spanish Government appeared with the demand that the miserable wanderers quit Galveston Island. They replied that they could not treat with him in the absence of Lallemand. Day after day the relief their chief promised them was delayed. Then came a furious storm and a flood, such as swept the island in 1900, submerging the camp and huts to a depth of five feet. The remaining stores of the refugees were destroyed, and their suffering became intense. Immediate departure was imperative. The "perfect union and harmony" which up to this time had existed in the group went to the winds and each began to think how he might save himself. "Some wanted to join the settlers on the island; others wanted to go to New Orleans, while still others thought of other American cities. France was the objective of most."</p>
<p>A few of the group did join Lafitte's band of pirates; many crossed to the mainland and proceeded on foot, some to Alexandria, Louisiana; others to Nacogdoches; but the majority walked the one hundred and fifty leagues to New Or-leans, supporting themselves solely by hunting. Those who remained behind, including Rigaud and his daughter, were furnished with a ship by Lafitte, together with such supplies as he could spare a prize captured from the Spanish, the <em>St. Anthony de Compeachy</em>—in which they finally reached New Orleans after a trying voyage.</p>
<p>From New Orleans most of the colonists returned to France; a few, it is said, joined the Spanish revolutionists.</p>
<p>General Charles Lallemand lived out the varied life of an adventurer and soldier of fortune, often in great poverty, until the Revolution of 1830 offered the chance to return to France—by Napoleon's will he had been left one hundred thousand francs. In 1832 he took his seat in the French Council of Peers, and, as a just reward for his faithfulness to Napoleon, he became military commander of Corsica. He died at Paris in 1839. His younger brother, Henri had, just before the Texas expedition, married a niece and one of the heiresses of Stephen Girard, rich merchant of Philadelphia, which explains why he was not of the Texas company. Rigaud remained in New Orleans and died there in 1820, not knowing that he, too, shared in Napoleon's will to the extent of one hundred thousand francs.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="editors-preface"><a class="header" href="#editors-preface">Editor's Preface</a></h1>
<p>This work, whatever be the judgment which may be formed of it, is not a <em>novel</em>. The facts set down here are true, except that <em>Ernestine</em> and <em>Edmund</em> are not the names of my hero and heroine; I have thought it best to change them.</p>
<p>If there are persons who charge that I have made use of information already set down by others, I shall answer them as follows: Texas has become a rich field and anyone may exploit it. The newspapers have published various letters recounting events which transpired there: each colonist or refugee may on his return to France have his story of it printed, without anyone having the right to accuse him of plagiarism. The facts will be the same; the editing alone will offer variations. I have obtained details in this way, and I have used them; I have enlarged or modified them according to my taste, and I have turned them to account in the most advantageous way for the success of the work which I offer to the public.</p>
<p>M. Ladvocat brought out, sometime ago, a work on Texas. In it, he gave, on pages 25 and following, some information on the geographical situation of this province.</p>
<p>Messrs. Hartmann and Millard, members of the Champ d'Asile colony, but lately returned to France, have just published an historical treatise on that which they took part in or observed. I have looked through these two works: many of the details are the same; the style alone is different, and the resemblance between the two accounts is much more striking on page 122 <em>et seq.</em> where these gentlemen speak of the soil and the products —in a word, of everything which shows the resemblance between this country and Mexico.</p>
<p>M. Ladvocat, who had the advantage of priority, could then assail them. They could answer: we were on the ground; he could reply: I published my work before yours and etc., a series of interminable discussions. On all sides one would hear repeated with more or less vigor: <em>I have pillaged, thou hast pillaged, he has pillaged.</em> Well! Gentlemen! A fourth, more reasonable and cooler, would say to them, <em>We have all stolen:</em> let us sell, believe me, in peace, our more or less true stories about Texas. That is what should concern us. The essential point is to have a big sale and to secure the honor of a second edition.</p>
<p>As to the claims which historians of Texas—present or to be—could make, they will be answered as simply as naturally:</p>
<p><em>"Everyone at this business<br/>
Can fruitlessly waste ink and paper.”<br/></em></p>
<p>I come back to the question in hand. It shall perhaps be urged against me that I have enlarged too much on the loves of Edmund and Ernestine; I answer that these developments seemed necessary to me, and that having omitted nothing of all that happened in Texas from the arrival of the French refugees in Champ d'Asile to their departure, I thought that the first duty of an historian was to portray in all their beauty and heroism the graces, glory and virtue of the exiles, and that this was the surest means of commending myself, as well as my work, to the indulgence of the readers.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="introduction-1"><a class="header" href="#introduction-1">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>The emigration of a great number of Frenchmen to the United States and the gathering of a group of them on the banks of the Trinity River in the province of Texas, where they proposed to found a colony under the name of Champ d'Asile, aroused considerable interest in their favor. The French who remained in the mother country had seen with sorrow, but with admiration, that friends and brothers, after the storm, were determined to found a new fatherland on another hemisphere. Among the group were those brave men who for twenty-five years astonished the world by their brilliant exploits, now, and as if to obtain additional glory in the eyes of their contemporaries and posterity, thought to civilize a savage country and cultivate a virgin soil. Everyone wished the new colony success and prosperity.</p>
<p>It was with pleasure that the French at home learned that Champ d'Asile was to be founded; and it was with satisfaction, slightly mixed with pride, that they saw about to be demonstrated the saying that, <em>to Frenchmen, "Everything is possible."</em> The vindication of this truth flattered the egotism of a nation known for its elevation of soul, its innate love of glory, and its penchant for great deeds. The interest grew when it was known that women had followed the fortunes of the refugees, undeterred by the weakness of their sex. Their strength of character and fortitude held them close to those with whom they had fearlessly cast their lot, hoping to enrich their lives and sweeten their memories and regrets, if perchance they should become homesick for their country. Love and attachments moved some; filial devotion, others; all had a motive worthy of praise and of respect.</p>
<p>So long as the life of the colony was calm and untroubled, while its early happiness was undisturbed, these faithful helpmates of our generous brothers exhibited only those sweet virtues which constitute the charm of domestic life. When hatred and persecutions—cruel daughters of passion—aroused the countries adjacent to Texas, and threatened the expulsion of the colonists from their new fatherland, the French women, so worthy of their high name, gave proof that their courage was equal to that of their husbands, relatives, and friends, and their strength grew in proportion to their need.</p>
<p>It is of one of these women that I am going to tell my readers, and in her I shall show heroism combined with beauty, virtue, and talents, and all the happy, rare, and precious qualities which go to make up the woman whom nature has chosen as a model closest approaching ideal perfection.</p>
<p>Ernestine, Edmund, you whose friend I was, you whose pleasures I have shared—but above all the pain and the dangers—you who gave me so often through example the strength to bear these burdens and to overcome them; you who, so to speak, renewed my being twice over, doubling my fortitude, allow me to devote my pen to the task of tracing the story of your love and constancy. I shall try to excite in the hearts of my readers the emotion you inspire in me. I announce to them that it is Edmund who is going to speak.</p>
<p>He has so often spoken to me of his life in Texas and on Galveston Island, both in the presence of Ernestine and on our excursions beyond the confines of the camp, that after a fashion I shall make use of his own expressions, though I shall not have that fire, that enthusiasm which marked him, which animated his words, his looks, his slightest gesture.
One would have to be in his place, to be consumed, as he was, by that pure true love, which moved his heart and fettered his faculties. When he uttered the name of his beloved, his voice was no longer the same, it took on an expression which startled me, and which I clearly felt, though I cannot describe the emotion it aroused.</p>
<p>I warn my readers that the names of Edmund and Ernestine are not those of the two colonists concerned; for I thought it more seemly to change them. But what I shall have to say is none the less strictly true.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="edmund-meets-ernestine"><a class="header" href="#edmund-meets-ernestine">Edmund Meets Ernestine</a></h1>
<p>Let us listen to Edmund:</p>
<p>I was in barracks at P—— with my regiment. For a long time my recreation lay in careful attention to my duty and in companionship with small groups of my comrades, walking, going to plays, and readings. It chanced one day that I met a friend who was spending several days with his parents in the city where we were. I had known him in his regiment, for we had been together in barracks, and a certain similarity in disposition drew us together. We even wrote to each other frequently. He was very glad to see me, and I shared his pleasure. He made me promise to come to see him. I assured him I would certainly take advantage of his invitation; after he had given me his address we separated.</p>
<p>Several days passed before I was able to go to his home, for drilling and reviews prevented me, and I felt put out about it without exactly knowing why. Finally one morning I left my quarters at a suitable hour for making calls, and a cab soon took me to the neighborhood where my friend lived.
I entered a house of rather handsome exterior and was met by a servant who opened the door and showed me to the person I sought. As soon as he saw me, he came forward and reproached me for what he called my forgetfulness, for, in his opinion, I had waited too long to return his visit.
I tried to excuse myself, and we went upstairs to his apartment. After we talked some time of what had happened to us both since last we met, he suggested that he introduce me to his parents, who, without actually knowing me, thought of me as their son's friend for it seems he had been rather kind in his remarks of me to them.</p>
<p>We then came down and found his father and mother waiting in the parlor for lunch to be announced. When my friend told them who I was, indulgent smiles and the most flattering words were their response. They invited me to have lunch with them, and I accepted. Scarcely had we. seated ourselves in the dining-room when my friend's mother said to the servant in attendance:</p>
<p>"Will you ask my daughter to come down?" and the man left the room.</p>
<p>A few moments later I saw my friend's sister enter. I glanced at her, then how can I describe what I felt? Imagine a divine being who bows with as much grace as modesty who comes to embrace her father, mother and brother, and to wish them good day in such a delightfully sweet and harmonious voice that I felt emotion take full possession of all my senses.</p>
<p>I had begun by doing full justice to the meal, and was most favorably disposed towards it, but suddenly my appetite disappeared; and I could no longer think of anything but of the person who had just shed into my soul a radiance which I could not as yet define.</p>
<p>May I try to describe Ernestine for it was by this name her mother called her in offering her some dish? Can you imagine a young woman of rich proportions, of the most regular beauty, whose complexion was far whiter than the lily and more delicately pink than the rose? She had the most beautiful eyes, and the artless arrangement of her heavy hair, coiled carelessly upon her head, but enhanced her charm; a fresh mouth, set with two rows of pearls; two small white hands which beautified everything they happened to touch. All of this gives you but a faint idea of Ernestine.</p>
<p>Although I was so taken with her that I could attend to nothing else, I yet hoped my attitude did not appear to be one of affectation; and when my friend urged me to eat, drawing me momentarily out of my contemplation, I continued with my food, still unable to remove my eyes from her who had become my idol, whom I loved, whom I adored with a love and admiration which she merited.</p>
<p>When my friend's parents asked me several questions I answered, and they seemed satisfied.</p>
<p>Ernestine, who up until this moment had not so much as glanced in my direction, now deliberately favored me with a look. She appeared a thousand times more beautiful.</p>
<p>Her mother told her to serve us, which she did; and when the time came for me to take the plate she handed me, I hastened to cover with my hand the spot her fingers had touched. I imagined that I was pressing Ernestine's hand and a delicious sensation crept over me.</p>
<p>Some of my readers doubtless will find me sentimental; and in truth lam, for such is my nature; it is my good fortune, and to those critics I might say: "Ah! if you had but known Ernestine."</p>
<p>A few words spoken by Ernestine's mother enlivened the conversation during the meal which, although fairly long, was surely drawing to a close. My friend answered his mother, the father took part, and soon we all joined in.</p>
<p>Ernestine gave voice to several reflections which told me her mind and her powers of discernment were consistent with her charm, and that such thoughts could not be better expressed, nor in more careful terms.
When we arose from the table, everyone was for going into the garden. I dared not offer my hand to Ernestine, but as I presented it to her mother, Ernestine's father said to her, smilingly:</p>
<p>"Come, my dear, let me be your escort, since neither of these young gentlemen is gallant enough to offer you his arm."</p>
<p>At that, as he gave her his arm, she returned his show of affection, and we all, including my friend, went into the garden.</p>
<p>The spot we were rambling over was indeed a delightful one. On the right I saw a little flower bed surrounded by trellises where could be seen an arbor with a plot of grass.</p>
<p>My friend said to me: "This is Ernestine's garden; it is she who tends it, who waters these flowers; the roses, the violets, the mignonette; all that you see owes its freshness and its beauty to her."</p>
<p>I wanted to make some answer but with a lover's timidity I dared not raise my voice.</p>
<p>It can be imagined how delighted I was to be upon ground Ernestine so often trod, to inhale the perfume of the flowers which she herself cultivated.</p>
<p>We walked along the borders, and since I had a slight knowledge of botany, I could but speak of it. At this Ernestine began to question me and, oh, delight! I hastened to answer her, but not without the liveliest emotion.</p>
<p>How happy I was that she seemed to agree with me!</p>
<p>She asked us to be seated, adding with a most charming smile that she did the honors there. Taking her mother's arm she said: "Come, mother, sit in my place." I examined Ernestine's nook and saw that the branches of the rose-trees and other hedges had been rounded over her head, and that holly-hocks grew about the arbor whose beauty Ernestine was wont to enhance with her own loveliness.</p>
<p>I sat down on the grass which every day she set her foot upon, and I was still happier.</p>
<p>We were all five there, Ernestine between her parents, I next to her brother, talking of flowers which Ernestine loved so much.</p>
<p>She saw a pink leaning awry upon its stem and she hastened to sprinkle it. I had the opportunity to notice that the most beautiful foot also belonged to the most beautiful of women. What perfection! Oh, Ernestine! What a supernatural being you looked to my eyes.</p>
<p>Now today that you are mine, you are all the more so—you are mine and I know not how to believe my good fortune! What have I done to deserve it?</p>
<p>After a few moments we quitted Ernestine's arbor to have a look about the garden. Soon the ladies left us to make their toilets, for they were going out.</p>
<p>Before leaving they bowed to us, and Ernestine's mother invited me to come to see them.</p>
<p>"You are my son's friend," she said to me kindly, "and so the house is open to you." I thanked her, and they left us.</p>
<p>I followed Ernestine with my eyes, beholding with delight her elegant figure, and the simple white dress she wore without other ornaments. She had suppressed everything more striking. When I lost sight of her, I felt as if I could see her still.</p>
<p>Her brother said to me, “I am going out, my dear Edmund, and if you have no plans, won't you come with me? I have to speak with a certain person, and afterward we will walk." I accepted, and he went to get his hat and cane.</p>
<p>His father said to me, "You haven't yours," and we walked in the direction of the house.</p>
<p>My friend was waiting. His father renewed the invitation which had already been extended to me, and I, promising to take advantage of the permission just granted, departed with the son.</p>
<p>When we had done our errand and paid several visits, we set out for a walk. I was dying to speak of Ernestine, but dared not as yet broach the subject, when my friend relieved my embarrassment by saying, "Well, you knew me but not my family. What do you say of my parents, how do you like my sister?"</p>
<p>"I can only congratulate you on belonging to them," was my answer.</p>
<p>"Oh, my friend, if you knew what a happy combination of goodness, virtues and lovable qualities there are combined in those dear persons whom we have just left!"</p>
<p>"To judge from all I have seen in my friend," I added, "there are few families which possess to a greater degree all that makes up the charm of life."</p>
<p>"You are right," he said, "and I am going to let you be the judge."</p>
<p>You can imagine with what interest I waited to hear what he was about to tell me, for necessarily Ernestine's name would come up in the conversation, and, moreover, he himself was much like her. His voice, though masculine, was much like hers, and though he was already my friend, he was to become still closer to me.</p>
<p>“I like to speak of my parents, " he began. "You have seen my father—he is an excellent man, wise without pretense; nothing is strange to his mind, for he can discuss everything with a rare insight. He is a good husband, a good father, and twenty-five years of married life have in no wise diminished his love for my mother, who is, moreover, his friend. My sister and I are his only riches, his fortune meaning nothing to him except in so far as he can make people happy through its use. My mother is like my father; their life together is the perfect reflection of a happy day, and since I have known them, not even the smallest cloud has darkened their union. The will of one is always the desire of the other; they are an example of congeniality of disposition and spirit which it would be difficult to match.</p>
<p>"My sister possesses all the characteristics I admire in my parents. I say nothing of her beauty, for one has only to see her to realize it; her talents and her learning are equal to her charms of which she is neither vain nor proud, and if the same blood did not course in our veins, I should have asked nothing better than to spend my life in adoring her. Fortunate a thousand and one times, my dear Edmund, the man who will prove worthy to be her husband, and who will be able to stir her heart; for although she is possessed of an exquisite sensitiveness, it will not be the matter of a moment to win her love."</p>
<p>What a delight it was to me to hear the one loved, whose perfections I had already divined, so praised. My friend did not speak for a moment, though I still gave ear. We went on a few steps in a silence which I finally broke in fear and embarrassment.</p>
<p>"Your sister, my friend, must be the object of universal desires and reverence; has she, perhaps, made her choice?"</p>
<p>"No! My parents, who are rather hard to please when it comes to choosing their friends, have casual acquaintances and go in society, but are intimate with no one; besides, my mother is my sister's closest friend; they are inseparable. If an unfamiliar sentiment were to move her heart, I am sure she would have no other confidant than her and my father, who idolizes his daughter. They love her more than they do me, though the tenderness of my parents for their son is marked; she merits this preference, and I am not jealous of it. Besides how could one dare be envious of Ernestine? How could one dare to compare himself to my good, my excel-lent, my wonderful sister?"</p>
<p>"You are right," I said in tones of enthusiasm. "How fortunate you are to be her brother, to see her every hour!"</p>
<p>"Heavens!" he said smiling to me, "How you do take fire, dear Edmund!" and he regarded me intently. "Don't go falling in love with my sister, for I cannot answer for her undertaking your cure; yet I do not wonder that you should, since you have seen her."</p>
<p>Our walk was at an end, for he was to return to his parents, and when we parted he made me promise to come back to see them.</p>
<p>"You have been invited by everyone; come, and I shall always find a new pleasure in being with you."</p>
<p>He pressed my hand and turned away. I followed him with my glance, finding something of Ernestine in the whole of his person; but I soon lost sight of him and felt myself alone in the world.</p>
<p>l abandoned myself to my dreams, Ernestine alone occupying my thoughts: retracing in memory all that her brother had told me of her, all that I had seen myself, I made vows and gave myself up to desires which doubtless were foolish but the land of dreams is the domain of lovers and poets.
I returned home absorbed in these reflections. When night came I could not resist the temptation to draw near to Ernestine, that I might breathe the same air with her. I changed my clothes, put on a coat, pulled my round hat down over my eyes, and sped to the neighborhood where Ernestine dwelled.</p>
<p>Everything was calm and peaceful as I approached her house with darkness favoring me. The shutters were closed, and I stationed myself opposite against the wall where I could see lights in the rooms. Soon the sound of a harp was heard, playing a prelude, and then a voice, as sweet as it was melodious, intoned some words I could not distinguish.</p>
<p>But my beating heart told me without doubt that it was Ernestine who was singing and accompanying herself, and I stayed until I no longer heard anything. Then I returned to my lodging, more smitten than ever, wishing passionately for the dawn of day, that I might go back to be near Ernestine once more.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="edmund-sees-ernestine-again"><a class="header" href="#edmund-sees-ernestine-again">Edmund Sees Ernestine Again</a></h1>
<p>I passed the night a victim to the most violent agitation, for sleep flies from lovers. Finally, when day-break began to chase away the shadows of night, I prepared to go out, and I was ready a great while before I heard the ringing of the bell which marks the hour when it is permissible to call.</p>
<p>This hour, so much desired, rang out on the air, and I left, guided by love and hope. I was intoxicated at the thought of seeing Ernestine. I reached my destination; but suddenly something, I knew not what stayed me. I reflected: though they have invited me to come back, to appear the very day following might not be exactly the thing; I might displease them; and at this thought I retraced my steps. Twenty times was I on the point of conquering this false pride, this timidity and twenty times did I resist the desire, while a secret voice said to me: "Go, and thou wilt find happiness." I spent the whole day in that state of uncertainty and anxiety, and evening found me still undecided. I did not see Ernestine.</p>
<p>The next day brought the same torments. I was undecided as to what I should do, when I received a letter from my friend, reproaching me for failing to avail myself of the invitation which had been extended me, but telling me that nevertheless I was expected for lunch, and that, if l foresaw no active service during the next two days, I must spend the time with his family in the country. I leaped for joy when I read that precious note, and went to the colonel to ask him for two days leave. I secured it and flew at once to Ernestine on wings of love and hope.</p>
<p>When I arrived, they reproached me in the most pleasing manner, and I tried to excuse myself without divulging my real reason; but my friend guessed it and smiled. My eyes were seeking for Ernestine. Her brother said maliciously: "I wish to announce Ernestine to you." She in fact did come in, a straw hat dangling in her hand. Heavens! but she was beautiful! I bowed to her, spoke to her. She answered artlessly, without affectation, that they had been expecting me, while she petted a little dog which seemed very dear to her. I stammered out a few insignificant words, for one is so stupid when one is in love. Ernestine looked at me a moment, then turning to her mother, asked her what was the hour fixed for our departure.</p>
<p>"After lunch, my dear," was the answer.</p>
<p>We sat down at the table to a short meal. It was announced that the horses were in the carriage, and we went down. We set out with the ladies inside, the father and I in front, and my friend on horseback. What good fortune! I found myself opposite Ernestine. I could look at her to my heart's content.</p>
<p>Her hat, adorned with but a simple ribbon knotted under her chin, made her face more strikingly lovely. The little dog, which was one of the party, climbed into my lap, and although they wanted to drive him off, I begged them to leave him, since he was Ernestine's.</p>
<p>I was happy.</p>
<p>The various scenes which presented themselves to our eyes were the topic of conversation. The subject of drawing came up, and, since I was possessed of a certain amount of talent, I spoke of it not badly, I believe, I saw my three travelling companions smile, without understanding why.
As we were going at a lively clip, we were not long in reaching our destination. Ernestine, light as air, jumped quickly down. Two young children came to embrace her, and we went into the house.</p>
<p>My friend had gone ahead, and we found ourselves in a pretty parlor whose simplicity was its greatest charm. Some framed drawings of very fine execution, constituted the decoration, and on examining them, I recognized the various scenes along our road to the house. Only then did I divine the cause for the smiles, and I suspected at once that the drawings were Ernestine's work. Why had I not guessed? Had her brother not told me that she was possessed of every talent?</p>
<p>He now aroused me from my observations by inviting me to make a tour of the house. We went over all the apartments while Ernestine was with her mother, who was giving orders, and seemed much gayer than in town. We found them downstairs, and Ernestine came playfully up, asking me if I played with my sister, to which I replied that I had none.</p>
<p>"Oh, that is a shame," she said.</p>
<p>"Yes, but I should like to have one, if she were like you."</p>
<p>"How gallant you are, M. Edmund; that is fine," and she turned away, my heart following her.</p>
<p>I believed myself transported into another world. I could see Ernestine and was privileged to spend two days with her, during which I said to myself, "Ah, if they could but go on forever." But happy hours hurry past.</p>
<p>I sought her out ceaselessly, wishing to secure command of my desire, my glances, and my impatience. Her brother who was with me, and who was of a happy disposition, observed me with a sly smile, as I everywhere looked for Ernestine's things, or an object she might have made. A piano had been placed in the parlor, and upon it there was a sonata with a violin accompaniment which she had copied. I sat down to the instrument and played the prelude. Ernestine came up to me.</p>
<p>"Ah, M. Edmund, you are a musician," she said at once. "How delightful! You shall soon accompany me, if you but will. Go on!"</p>
<p>It was the first time Ernestine had spoken to me in such a direct fashion, and I felt the strongest, yet the sweetest emotion. I did not lose my head, however, and went on with the piece. I do not know whether it was that love came to my aid, or that I was galvanized by Ernestine, but never did any violin bring forth such sounds from beneath the bow. Ernestine's father and mother came into the parlor, but I was unaware of their presence until a bravo of applause resounded when I had finished playing the piece. I was complimented on what they were pleased to call my talent, and it was agreed that in the evening we should have some more music. As we left the room my friend said to me, "Let's go for a walk."</p>
<p>Ernestine, who remained with her parents, smiled when she saw us leaving, and added, "We will have the music soon." My answer was a nod. I was too greatly agitated to speak a word, and I had to content myself with allowing my glance to dwell for a moment upon the idol of my heart.</p>
<p>We crossed the garden and soon found ourselves in the open country. Ernestine's brother began the conversation. "I did not know you were a musician, my ear Edmund; it is a desirable talent, and a great resource in all the circumstances of life; for music makes solitude more beautiful, and in society it is both useful and pleasant. Better still, it reveals amiability, which goes with good morals and regular conduct. You played that prelude a little while ago with expression which would do credit to a consumate [sic] artist." He looked at me as he spoke, "Your instrument appeared to live and breathe beneath your fingers; you seemed really inspired."</p>
<p>He smiled knowingly, and I began to be embarrassed, but I took myself in hand and answered him, "Music is one of the accomplishments for which I have a taste, and which I have cultivated with care. I have been a soldier for a long time, and it, together with reading, are becoming my only diversions. I do not care for noisy pleasures, and still less for gaming; I associate with my comrades without being intimate with any, for I rather like being alone; my violin and my books afford me some delightful moments. When I am with them, I am never bored."</p>
<p>"You would get on well with us: my family has tastes similar to yours; my sister is an excellent musician and sings charmingly. If you were but to hear her at the harp or piano you would be astonished; such harmonious expression and brilliant technique are rare. You will soon know for yourself, and I am persuaded that you will not be sorry to accompany Ernestine. What do you say to it?"</p>
<p>"I shall be very flattered."</p>
<p>"I think so."</p>
<p>His glance followed me and his eyes questioned mine. I wanted to appear at ease, but I was disturbed.</p>
<p>"My dear Edmund," he added, "you are trying to hide your feelings; I am going to confide in you: It is not for nothing that you have seen my sister, and I am not surprised at this, for such has been the story of all those who approach her; but the effect on you, I see, has been real and lasting. Your emotion is still too new to be a menace to your reason; I would advise you to use this reason, for I know my sister well enough to be sure that she will not easily share the feeling she may inspire. With her it is respect that will give birth to love. Please do not feel, dear Edmund, that I do not think you worthy of inspiring both; on the contrary, but the path is stormy for him who would win my sister. I would not so far do you an injustice as to suspect you of being capable of employing other means than those allowable to a man of delicate honor. No, you are my friend, and that name tells you enough of what I think of you. But since you love my sister, I am sure that the two days you will spend with us will not be without danger for you. But after all, it is your own affair."</p>
<p>I replied, "You must know, my friend, that what you have just said embarrasses me. But I must speak to you frankly, for such is the need, the desire of my heart. Yes, I love your beautiful Ernestine and I feel that it is forever."</p>
<p>He laughingly interrupted me.</p>
<p>"Lover's words, my dear Edmund. Remember that this fire which consumes you, as it has so many others, is too violent not to die more or less quickly; for, in general, it doesn't last long."</p>
<p>"You do your sister an injustice; when one really loves her, it must be for life."</p>
<p>"I grant you that she may be an exception to the rule, and that you, knowing and appreciating her, may not easily change; but, after all, we are both men; love is, they say, a weakness, which may be destroyed by another weakness."</p>
<p>"When one loves Ernestine, it is a virtue, and I, for my part, can tell you that when one possesses this virtue it but grows stronger with the passing days."</p>
<p>"That last word forces me to hold my peace, my dear Edmund. I am conquered, and acknowledge my defeat. Do not forget this expression, much less the fact, for it can be useful to you. Does one know? A tender tie goes further than one might think. But let's return; we have been gone for a long time."</p>
<p>I could ask nothing better, for I was going to see Ernestine again. We began speaking of other things, and were soon back.</p>
<p>The first person I saw was Ernestine. This meeting appeared to me in the light of a happy augury, particularly as I now found her prettier and more charming than ever, and was hourly discovering new beauties in her. I divined many precious qualities: but time alone could show me, could make me appreciate her judgment, her mentality, and the strength of her mind. She reproached us for our too-prolonged absence and said, "Gentlemen, you should not leave the company so when you are in the country. Such behavior is to be reproved. At any rate, dear brother, I see your influence there, for you are always having to run up hill and down dale."</p>
<p>"It was a pleasure to show Edmund the country surrounding our home, and then we gossiped about some very interesting things."</p>
<p>"And about what, gentlemen, if you please?"</p>
<p>"Oh, about the beauties of—nature."</p>
<p>"That does not surprise me; Edmund is well up in botany." With any other man than my friend, than Ernestine's brother, I would have been afraid of an indiscretion, but he respected his sister too much, he respected himself too much, to forget the consideration he owed her, and which I myself had a right to expect of him.</p>
<p>Ernestine asked me what I thought of the landscape I had seen.</p>
<p>"Very pretty, very interesting; the views are varied and picturesque; and I would willingly spend my life here."</p>
<p>The conversation went no further.</p>
<p>M. and Madame Dormeuil came in—for this was the name of Ernestine's parents.</p>
<p>"Ah, here are our travelers," said M. Dormeuil. "You are exercising very early in the morning, gentlemen. I heartily approve, and at your age I would have done the same thing. Today although I am at liberty to stretch my legs, I am a little more of a stay-at-home. I confine my walks to my garden or to short rambles in the country. When we wish to visit some neighbors, we all go together, Madame and I and dear Ernestine; but her small delicate foot suffers somewhat from the hard earth. Fortunately, she will never have to travel on foot, at least; isn't that true, daughter?"</p>
<p>"Yes, dear papa," she said, and a kiss ended the sentence.</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle," added I, in my turn, "will never go on any long voyage?"</p>
<p>"Not without fear, for I should not like the ocean. But, after all, I am wrong to talk this way, for one should not fear what one does not know, and, moreover, one has to take circumstances into account and to know at need how to face the storm."</p>
<p>Madame Dormeuil looked at her daughter. As for me, I admired her: the freshest of mouths had just opened to give expression and sound to a reasoned observation.</p>
<p>Madame Dormeuil turned laughingly to me: "My daughter is the stuff heroines are made of, and she would become one if need be."</p>
<p>"Why not, Mama," returned Ernestine, "do you think me spineless and without energy? Be kinder to yourself, as well as to my good father; l am your child and I can and must be like you.”</p>
<p>"That's all very well, sister," added the younger Dormeuil; "let it go at that. I can judge you much better; and I think you are capable of doing all that is kind, gentle, generous, even extraordinary."</p>
<p>"Dear brother, that is too much, that is exaggeration, flattery—but I forgive you for it. M. Edmund, don't take all that seriously. I am far from being a prodigy."</p>
<p>"I think, Mademoiselle, that the picture is not a flattering one."</p>
<p>There was quiet at this, and I added nothing more. Oh, Ernestine! You were too modest, and I did not yet know how to appreciate you. How far you were above all the praise heaped upon you, you did not yourself know.</p>
<p>The younger Dormeuil changed the subject by reminding us that we were to play, and that I was to accompany Ernestine, an idea which met with the approval of the father. I took up the violin, Ernestine seated herself at the piano, and we began. It was a sonata of one of our great masters, and Ernestine performed it with marked superiority, while I had the good fortune to accompany her in a way that called forth praise.</p>
<p>"Very fine, M. Edmund," with charming grace, "just think what it would have been if you had studied this sonata. Oh, we shall practice together which will have the added advantage of giving my parents some pleasant moments, for they both love and understand music."</p>
<p>I assured Ernestine that I would try to follow her, and I accepted her proposal to play several variations, being delighted to see that she surpassed all her brother had said.</p>
<p>I begged her to sing, and she charmingly complied with modesty and real talent. My violin blended with the pathos of her pure and melodious voice; and in a mirror which was opposite the piano I could see reflected her angelic countenance. Oh, Ernestine, when you sang those verses on friendship, you made them divine by the expression you put into the words; your soul imparted a new life to the thought, to the language of the gods. What would it have been like if you had sung of love?</p>
<p>I believed myself transported into another world, an illusion to which Ernestine gave the charm of reality. What happiness! No alien thought came near to trouble her, and my heart, my love, my rapture were as pure as was she who was the object of my homage and my secret desires, and I knew that until this moment, I had not existed. Ernestine changed everything, and I became a new being. immediately conceived the desire to be worthy of her, to rid myself of all my faults, and to try to please her was to make a resolution to become better.</p>
<p>We had music several times during those two days; we talked of literature, of science and art. M. Dormeuil spoke familiarly of all, and Madame Dormeuil showed herself worthy of being Ernestine's mother. Hers was the most refined taste, hers the most delicate tact, and the purest utterances.</p>
<p>The choicest words came naturally to her lips, and her manner agreed with all else. The most regular handwriting completed the list. The younger Dormeuil possessed merits and much learning, but his sister was a dangerous rival for him.</p>
<p>Those sweet moments, which I never would have wanted to see an end to, sped by. We returned to P—, and when they invited me to spend the rest of the day with them, I begged their permission to show myself to the Colonel in order to prove that I had not overstayed the leave so graciously granted me. When I presented myself, he received me kindly, for I had won his esteem by my faithfulness in the performance of duty.</p>
<p>After having spoken to him of what was pertinent to my office, I retired, went home to change my clothes, and was soon at M. Dormeuil's house, where they thanked me for my promptness, and before long we all sat down at the table. My love, already great, was growing with each instant. Oh, you who have been in love, have pity on me, for I had not yet dared speak of it! I had no confidant other than my heart, of whose state you may easily judge. After the dinner, which was rather prolonged, we went into the salon, M. and Madame Dormeuil and Ernestine going on into another room; and when the son proposed that we go down into the garden to take the air, I accepted with alacrity. Scarcely had we found ourselves there when he began speaking to me in this wise:</p>
<p>"Do you know, my dear Edmund, that you are creating a sensation here? I am really flattered, because I am convinced that you deserve it. My parents are pleased with you, and have congratulated me upon having made your acquaintance. Even my sister speaks well of you; and she can do so without apprehension, since she is in agreement with my parents.
This is not a bad augury for your suit, and how can one tell? In time people end by knowing each other better, and… “</p>
<p>I interrupted him, "Oh, my dear friend, do not go on, do not encourage me with a hope which, though I yield myself to it, may never be realized! I am in love with, I adore, I idolize your sister; I do not dare to fathom, to look into the future. I am, however, abandoning myself to the feeling which leads me. How would it be then if I dreamed that such a great happiness could fall to my lot? My dear Dormeuil, have pity on the emotion to which you see me a victim. You must condone and pardon me, for Ernestine is the cause of it. What would I not do in order to be worthy of her choice! I would give half of my life to be able to devote the remainder to her."</p>
<p>At the same time I was firmly grasping my friend's hand, and was speaking with an emotion and a fire which astonished him, and which threw him into a silence that he finally broke, saying "Calm yourself, get over this upset; your very features are altered, your voice changed. Let us go as far as the end of the garden, we will return directly, and I advise you to go to your room a few moments, for you need to be alone; and believe me, my friend, that if I speak thus to you it is for your own good. If one day my parents and Ernestine must know of your feelings, you will grant that at present they are ignorant of them. As for me, rest assured your secret lies buried in my heart, and that the friendship I bear you will be the seal of its safety. Tomorrow morning at eight o'clock, I shall be in your quarters. Now come, tell all the family goodnight."</p>
<p>We went back into the parlor where the ladies were reading; M. Dormeuil was taking a walk. They spied us and said: "Ah, there you are, gentlemen, you must have secrets to tell each other, you seem so to love being together, all right, all right!"</p>
<p>When I spoke of leaving them, they renewed their invitation to me, not a general one, but for every day, saying my place would aways be set, and that I knew their meal hours, which was all that was necessary. I thanked them for a kindness, whose whole graciousness I understood, by assuring them I should try to be worthy. I was told that I had nothing to do to make myself so. When I bowed to the ladies and M. Dormeuil, Ernestine raised her beautiful eyes to mine and said, "'Till tomorrow then." Her brother ushered me to the door and I returned home.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="marriage-is-discussed"><a class="header" href="#marriage-is-discussed">Marriage Is Discussed</a></h1>
<p>"What! I shall see her every day!" I said to myself as I walked along, and I repeated it a hundred times before I reached my lodgings. Once there, I thought of all I had to fear or hope for. I loved for always, but did Ernestine share my passion? And, would her parents resign her to me? Her brother, it is true, was my friend.</p>
<p>Immediately a terrible and cruel thought came to tear at my heart and deprive me of all hope, for, I said, "He seems to be interested in me; but it is perhaps only through a sort of pity, a sort of humoring of a sick person, that he has lent an ear to my love. I shall see him tomorrow, and what will he have to say to me?" What a problem! I wanted to be with him, yet I dreaded his very presence. It was in this ebb and flow of ideas that the hours dragged past. Oh, love, how sweet are all thy pleasures: but how bitter are thy pains, how cruel thy torments! To make matters worse, Dormeuil kept me waiting. When he knocked I let him in and scanned his face to divine if he were going to tell me something disastrous; his greeting reassured me.</p>
<p>"Well, dear Edmund, how is your heart?" was his first question. "If your face is any indication, you did not sleep very well. Just think, you have known my sister only a few days, and already you are developing symptoms of real love; how on earth would it be if you had been in love for several years?—you would succumb. You assuredly do not, as yet, have to be sorry for yourself; if the one you love has promised you nothing, she at least has not refused you. I have not come to console you, my friend, to tell you to possess your soul in patience, that you will end by ruining your beauty. Neither do you hear me flattering you. You are thought of in my family, I am sure, only as an honest man who is good company; moreover no one at home has spoken to me of you, and I have been careful not to say a single word. You will come to see us today—perhaps each passing hour will better your position. Oh, I know that lovers are not very patient; that they are quick to take alarm; but also it takes but little to calm their fears. I suggest then that you get more of a hold on yourself, and though my sister, above all women, deserves to be loved, that is no reason for losing your head. What would they think of you if it was known that you are so weak? Friendship is forgiving, you know, and I shall bury in forgetfulness what I have just been a witness to. If Ernestine were to learn of it, you would certainly have no success with her. Come, my dear Edmund, be a man, and try to conquer your love—virtuous as it may be—even though she who inspires it is entirely worthy."</p>
<p>I had listened to Dormeuil without interrupting him, for felt the justice of his remarks. I was in love with Ernestine, and I thought I was right, without, however, being able to blame him.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your advice, my dear Dormeuil; it springs from interest and the sincerest attachment, and I must answer by explaining myself frankly; in opening my heart to you without reserve. I love your sister, you know, and henceforth nothing can change me, whatever my fate may be. To be happy, to attain the only blessing I desire, I shall use only such means as you yourself may indicate. You are my friend—now be my aide. I do not ask you to help me; I know that before I dare raise my eyes to Ernestine to speak to her of love, I must have her parents and her own permission; if I win it, I have nothing else to ask; if it is refused me, I shall, at least, have nothing to reproach myself for. I should, doubtless, in that event, complain of my destiny; but I would be at peace with honor, and so less unhappy!"</p>
<p>Dormeuil answered quickly: "One who holds such sentiments deserves happiness. Speak to my parents, to my sister, let them know you. Everything leads me to believe you will not be repulsed, and if you are favorably received, you may be certain that I shall do all within my power for you, considering all interests. Think about all that, dear Edmund; take several days to be sure that you are making progress in the minds of Ernestine and my parents; use the resources of your mind to please them; follow the impulses of your honest heart, which will not lead you astray. That is enough on that score. If you have nothing better to do, dress, and we will go out; and while you are waiting for the hour when you can come to the house, we will take a walk."</p>
<p>I accepted the offer, was quickly ready, and we set out. We met several officers of the regiment, who went along with us. In due time we separated, and my friend and I were soon in the house which had become my universe.</p>
<p>I was received as usual. I thought, however, I noticed more freedom, more cordiality in my welcome; Ernestine herself treated me with less indifference and said, when she saw me with her brother: "There are the two Inseparables." Then, assuming a little pout, which made her still prettier, she reproached her brother for his neglect since I had been coming to the house, threatening that she would be angry with him if it continued.</p>
<p>I answered that I could not forgive myself if I had been the cause of such a misfortune.</p>
<p>"Do not worry, my dear Edmund," Dormeuil said to me. "It would be the first time in her life for Ernestine to exhibit anger. You do not know her as yet, and besides, it is easy to judge for yourself if it is possible that such features can show anything but goodness of heart."</p>
<p>I approved my friend's judgment. M. and Madame Dormeuil smiled, and Ernestine said to her brother: "Will you hush? Sir, you know I do not like praise; besides, you make me blush at your words, and M. Edmund would end by accusing you of partiality."</p>
<p>I wanted to reply to this, but Ernestine got up and said: "We should never finish with this, and I am not sorry that luncheon will end this conversation."</p>
<p>When M. and Madame Dormeuil followed Ernestine, we all did likewise, and by chance, I found myself beside my idol. They treated me as if I were a member of the household.</p>
<p>"Make yourself at home," M. Dormeuil said to me, "for you are, so to speak, our regular guest," at which a little dialogue sprang up between us.</p>
<p>"I do not know how to accept such kindness."</p>
<p>"From the very first you inspired the greatest confidence in us; and, besides, your intimacy with my son, who is very hard to please in the choice of his friends and acquaintances, put me entirely at rest, for you must know that we do not open our doors to everyone. We know how to be content with each other, and strangers are not necessary to us. You have proved an exception to the rule, M. Edmund, as you know, and I foresee that we shall have reason to congratulate ourselves on a preference which you deserve."</p>
<p>"I shall try to justify that good opinion. Everything urges me that way and makes it a duty."</p>
<p>"Are your parents still living?"</p>
<p>At this question, an expression of pain must have crossed my face, and altered it perceptibly.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" asked Ernestine.</p>
<p>"Nothing, Mademoiselle. Your father has just reminded me of what I lost in my parents, and I am sad."</p>
<p>"A cruel thing it is, not to be able to embrace one's parents every day."</p>
<p>M. Dormeuil was quick to say: "I am indeed sorry to have revived your grief; but it does you honor, and I am persuaded that you were a good son, and with that precious quality, one always has many others. How old are you, sir?"</p>
<p>"Twenty-eight."</p>
<p>"You should think of marrying, for I am sure that you would make your wife happy."</p>
<p>"I intend to follow my father's example. To form those bonds, a man must find the right woman, and often the one upon whom we look with love, who attracts and deserves our choice, cannot belong to us. It is much easier to love than to be loved."</p>
<p>“I am aware of that, but you have all that is necessary to your success. What is your fortune?"</p>
<p>"Forty thousand francs income."</p>
<p>"That can smooth out money difficulties."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, but that is not all; when one consults only the material side, happiness is not always present."</p>
<p>I was not displeased that M. Dormeuil had brought this subject up, and I saw that everyone was very attentive. Ernestine had a certain preoccupied air, and the younger Dormeuil looked at me half serious, half smiling, with a glance whose import only I could fathom.</p>
<p>M. Dormeuil went on: "Your observation is true; but when one is independent, one may find something that imparts a new value to his independence; and in the class of society in which you move, where you must look for a wife, there are young women who will make excellent mothers of families and most respectable wives."</p>
<p>"Certainly," added Madame Dormeuil, who until that moment had said nothing.</p>
<p>"Besides, sir," I went on, "for me to think of marriage would perhaps be unwise, for I am a soldier of rank, and since I have chosen the career of arms, I must follow it. should have to leave my wife; and, in the event of war breaking out again, such a separation would expose her to the cruellest uncertainties."</p>
<p>"Every calling has its advantages and disadvantages," said M. Dormeuil. "All that is compensated for in the life one leads. It is true that soldiers run great dangers; but it is also true that glory has its charms, for it elevates the soul and is a valuable incentive to men, and, upon my word, one does well to make sacrifices to it. Then, it must be admitted that women love warriors, for they have as much strength and courage as we have. And love of the kind a man would inspire in a woman must always give heed to the voice of honor; she would never counsel the one she loves to anything which might reflect upon honor. It must be said in their favor that women are perfect in this respect; they will always find in me a partisan and an apologist, for I am their knight against everything. Isn't that true, Ernestine?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Papa," she answered, "and I do not regret it."</p>
<p>"I am always right, with you."</p>
<p>"Consequently you are a spoiled child, very spoiled," said her brother, "but you deserve to be. Edmund, don't think she has taken advantage of the weakness we have for her. She is, really, next to my mother, the best of women; and if I were not her brother, I would have accomplished the impossible in order to become her husband."</p>
<p>I was bold enough to add: "Many men would be of the same mind, but that is a good fortune to which not everyone can aspire."</p>
<p>Dormeuil answered: "Not everyone, no; but men can be found who are worthy of this preference."</p>
<p>Ernestine, looking at both of us and smiling with infinite charm, said: "Gentlemen, will you please stop concerning yourselves with my marriage. If by chance someone sets eyes on me who is so inclined, he will speak of it, and I shall know it; if I like him, I will call my little council together, and we will then come to a decision. If you will hear me, let's have done with this and go into the parlor. I want to have music. I received some new pieces yesterday which I should like to try, and if M. Edmund is willing we shall attempt them."</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle, never was there anything more agreeable."</p>
<p>Everyone rose, and M. Dormeuil, clapping me on the shoulder, said: "Come, my friend—for I regard you as such—come play the violin while you are awaiting your marriage."</p>
<p>Everything was soon arranged. The music we were to try was Italian, by one of the best composers. Ernestine began; her light fingers, scarcely touching the keys, drew from the piano harmonies that sank into the soul. The instrument I had was excellent, and I commenced a solo, at which I surpassed myself. I was a changed mortal, for I was near Ernestine and could see her. When I finished, she said to me, "Ah, M. Edmund, how well you played that! Again please."</p>
<p>"Yes, again, again!" repeated the gallery.</p>
<p>I began again, Ernestine following with her eyes the movement of my bow. She, being an excellent musician, understood its different positions. I finished and let my hand fall.</p>
<p>"That's delightful," said she, taking mine in her own. I seized her beautiful hand, and raising it a little, I said, bending low: "Do you permit me, Mademoiselle?"</p>
<p>M. Dormeuil did not give her time to answer, "Yes, the encore merits that favor."</p>
<p>I pressed her hand with my lips, and I thought she trembled slightly. 0, sweet and unlooked-for happiness, how precious thou wast to me! The memory of thee still makes my heart beat faster. There are impressions which time cannot efface. Ernestine, I have been your husband for a long time, and I still experience those delightful sensations, for they are as real as at the moment I have just described.</p>
<p>I was asked if I had any voice, to which I answered, "A little." The younger Dormeuil got up and, looking about in his sister's music, drew out <em>The Timid Lover</em>, which he put on the rack. I could not retreat now, and as I glanced over the melody, Ernestine said she would accompany me.</p>
<p>"You will lend my voice a charm which otherwise it does not possess. " But my friend interrupted with, "Come, modest singer, begin!" And without appearing to do so intentionally, I sought to portray the fears and confusion of a lover who does not make an avowal, yet loves madly.</p>
<p>"That is very good; it is astonishing. You sing with a deal of taste," said M. and Madame Dormeuil.</p>
<p>"Ah! I made you a real present when I introduced Edmund to you, and you will thank me for it one day; you do not really know him as yet, for he has merit and you will see that he will get along in life," and he laughed.</p>
<p>Ernestine thoughtfully strummed a few notes on the piano, as if far away; M. and Madame Dormeuil complimented me, while I regarded in the mirror the reflection of Ernestine's lovely face. She arose, and glancing about with a look that seemed to take in the situation, went up to her mother and said, "Mama, let's go down into the garden," and we left.</p>
<p>As for me, my heart was aflame from the contact of my lips with Ernestine's hand. Once in the garden the flowers and the hedges occupied our attention. There was at the bottom, a little summer-house which I had not seen; it was Ernestine's work-room, and when we went in I found the walls fairly covered with pictures. I noticed her portrait drawn by herself, as well as those of her parents in which the resemblance was striking; all were of a delectable fineness.</p>
<p>"Do you draw, M. Edmund?" she said to me, while my eyes were fixed on her adored likeness.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mademoiselle, a little."</p>
<p>"Let's see what he can do," said the younger Dormeuil.</p>
<p>"Yes, let's," added the father; and, although I protested, they put a pencil in my hand, and I sat down. There was paper beneath my fingers, and the portrait of Ernestine before my eyes. I seized at once the opportunity and sketched in the features which were already engraved upon my heart. Love steadied my hand, guided my pencil; and the eyes fixed upon me soon saw a striking likeness.</p>
<p>"In truth, my dear Edmund, you can do anything," the father said to me. "Ernestine, what do you say to his work?" At this I rose and offered it to her. She took it, blushing a little.</p>
<p>"Thank you, it is very good; but you might have chosen another model."</p>
<p>"Ah, Mademoiselle," I replied, "what other could have been worthy of the choice, I ask you." And everyone, laughing, agreed with me.</p>
<p>I should have much liked to keep the precious sketch, but that would have been an indiscretion, and I did not even ask it as I watched Ernestine roll it up and hold it in her hand.</p>
<p>We left the summer-house and continued our walk in the garden, I near to M. Dormeuil, who addressed me.</p>
<p>"I see with pleasure, M. Edmund, that you are possessed of talents and knowledge; they are the fruits of your love for the arts and sciences, and prove, to your credit, that you did not consume your youth in futile occupations and dissipation. I am astonished that you should have attained to such a degree of perfection, since you are a soldier."</p>
<p>"Sir, the arts and sciences always held an irresistible attraction for me; and, as such pursuits leave in their wake neither regrets nor remorse, I abandoned myself entirely to them."</p>
<p>Ernestine did not speak; but as she walked I admired the elegance and grace of her body, her foot which seemed scarcely to press the earth, for in vain did I seek the imprint of her steps. Each instant I discovered a new charm in the object of my love which thus, to my delight, became more violent. When we reached her borders, she stepped in, pulled some flowers and made a bouquet of them. Her brother asked her for a rose, which she gave him, fastening it in his buttonhole.</p>
<p>"Everyone must have a flower," he said to her, and she gave one to her father, her mother and, at last, to me. How happy I was! I possessed something that had been hers. I thanked her, and we returned to the house, speaking of an afternoon jaunt which I was to join. M. and Madame Dormeuil and Ernestine were to go in the carriage; Dormeuil and I would ride horseback; thus the party was arranged to the satisfaction of all. I had to return to my quarters for my spurs, and my friend went with me so that I would be back more promptly. I was not sorry of his company, since I had so many things to tell him. I bowed to the ladies and we went out.</p>

<p>"My friend, your sister has made such an impression on me that I love her to the point where my happiness and my very existence are bound up in that sentiment. Give me your opinion; I intend to speak to your parents about it, and so have the goodness to warn them, to beg them to grant me a moment's interview. I think such are the preliminary steps in order to reach your sister; what do you think of them?"</p>
<p>"You are right, my friend; but I will say to my parents only that you wish to speak to them about a matter, and will not tell them what you have to say; for otherwise they would ask me questions, which, if I appeared to know more, would embarrass me, and besides, the more discreet you are, the more grateful will my parents and even Ernestine be to you for such attentions and the refinement of your demeanor. Do not worry; they will hear you, and I wish you the success you desire."</p>
<p>“Do you think they will listen to me with favor?"</p>
<p>"I could not say; but judging by the esteem they have for you, I think you may hope; the results will tell if I guess aright."</p>
<p>We reached my quarters, where I quickly changed my clothes, and on our return we found everything ready, and were soon in the open fields, we on horseback and they in the carriage. I rode a very pretty horse which jumped spiritedly several times, and when he tried to rear, I mastered him with difficulty, drawing a word of praise from Dormeuil. We rode, one on each side of the carriage, and Dormeuil in a very gay mood made us laugh, so that we were all soon in the humor, and agreeable talk and pleasantries were the burden of the conversation. I, in enchantment, could see Ernestine, who laughed at our silly actions and words, for we were spurred on still further by the most beautiful weather imaginable. What a happy day! What delightful moments! All had lately been so for me, and might become even happier. I desired, yet dreaded, the interview I had solicited, which was to take place on our return.</p>
<p>We did not proceed very rapidly, our horses being put at a slow trot so we could chatter at our ease as we rode along. We saw a little town in the distance; Dormeuil's proposal that we make a stop there was approved, and we were not long in reaching it. We got down, watered the horses, and moved over to the banks of the river but a short distance away. My friend took his mother's arm while I remained with M. Dormeuil and Ernestine. We were a little way from each other, and I suspected that Dormeuil would take advantage of the moment to make of his mother the request with which I had charged him. When we came up they were laughing, and Madame Dormeuil looked at me with a certain curiosity. We had to return to Paris, she said, and l imagined that I had something to do with this departure, which was more hurried than had been planned. We retraced our steps and were soon on our way home. The return was more quiet, for each was occupied with his own thoughts.</p>
<p>As we rode along, Dormeuil told me that as soon as we returned, I could speak to his mother, who had questioned him; but he had been reserved, insisting that he was absolutely ignorant of what I had to say. The nearer we approached to Paris, the more uneasy I became, and I looked at Ernestine, saying to myself, "What if I might possess entirely the most perfect thing that nature has formed! Ah, if I can win her, my happiness will exceed my hopes, and I shall have nothing left to live for; my whole life will be too little to insure the happiness of the most beloved of women."</p>
<p>I resolved to steel myself, for I might be refused, even though there was no real objection to me. Dormeuil, who was at my side, said to me: "You seem very preoccupied."</p>
<p>"Are you surprised at that? l am flying in the face of events that, in an hour perhaps, will decide my fate, and I shall be the most unfortunate or the happiest of men."</p>
<p>"Come, courage! A man, above all a soldier, should be ready for anything."</p>
<p>We were entering the city and our talk ceased. We arrived before M. Dormeuil's door, the carriage entered the yard, and we were soon in the parlor.</p>
<p>I noticed Madame Dormeuil leave the room. An instant later a servant came to say that she wished to speak to me, and, on following him, I found myself in her company. She saved me the embarrassment of speaking first, saying to me, smiling: "My son told me you wished to speak to me, M. Edmund. Tell me what I can do for you, and, if I consult only the friendship that you have inspired in me, all will be easy."</p>
<p>Although this beginning encouraged me, I experienced a rising emotion which she did not fail to notice.</p>
<p>"How now, it's really serious, then! You are trembling all over, but calm yourself and speak out. There is nothing in me which should frighten you." I then broached the subject.</p>
<p>"Madame, the way you have received me into your house has been truly flattering, and you have inspired me with respect and gratitude. I could not see her, who, besides yourself, is its chief ornament, without a lively and sincere sentiment. I love Mademoiselle Ernestine, and my happiness would be to tell her so, and to prove it to her. I have deemed it best to speak first to you, to obtain your views; and if they are not unfavorable, I might dare hope one day to be attached to you by the tenderest and most sacred of ties."</p>
<p>"Your request does me honor, M. Edmund, and the straightforwardness and consideration of your actions on this occasion but adds to the good opinion I already had of you. If I have a certain authority over my daughter, it does not go so far as to try to rule her heart. I believe she could not choose better, but before giving you the slightest hope, I must speak to her, as well as to M. Dormeuil, of your intentions. It is saying enough to you that I do not refuse you. Be discreet, and in a few days, sooner perhaps, you will know how the matter stands. Let us return to the others."</p>
<p>I thanked her for her kindnesses.</p>
<p>"Well, now," she went on, "how could I do other than approve of you, my friend?"</p>
<p>"Ah! madame, if it can only be that ere long you may give me another name!"</p>
<p>"I am aware of all the desire you may have for this other name, but patience was never a lover's virtue; come." And we returned to the parlor.</p>
<p>M. Dormeuil was alone, book in hand.</p>
<p>"Where do you two come from?"</p>
<p>"We had something to say to each other."</p>
<p>"All right, I am not curious."</p>
<p>The remainder of the day passed easily, and all that was said was of the greatest interest to me. Ernestine was still charming, but how could I have found her otherwise; each instant showed her more lovable, more attractive in my eyes.</p>
<p>I was forgetting that I should be gone when the striking hour reminded me.I begged them to pardon my indiscretion.</p>
<p>"Oh, there is no harm," said Madame Dormeuil with a very expressive smile.</p>
<p>"What can one do, Madame? Everything here takes me out of myself and holds me. I can well believe I am in my own home, so thoroughly do you seem to forget with pleasure that it is yours. I ask your pardon, a thousand times."</p>
<p>"You are not guilty—tomorrow then."</p>
<p>I left the room and came up with young Dormeuil.</p>
<p>"Well, did you speak to my mother?"</p>
<p>"Yes, nothing is decided yet."</p>
<p>"I imagine."</p>
<p>"If I have no definite hope, at least I did not elicit a refusal."</p>
<p>"I understand that, too."</p>
<p>"I shall have an answer in a few days, perhaps tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Will you come?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, for I am a prey to mortal dreads."</p>
<p>"That does not surprise me. Poor lover, I pity you. Do not come too early, but wait for me. I will come to fetch you, at which time I may, perhaps, be able to tell you some good news. Well, off with you now."</p>
<p>I left him. It would seem that he divined my impatience, for early the next day I saw him coming. He did not give me time to question him.</p>
<p>"My dear Edmund, when I had not even intended coming, they sent me. My mother acquainted father with your re-quest, who approved it, if Ernestine is willing. She was consulted and feels no repugnance, but has not yet given an answer. Your behaviour, however, has flattered her, and she appreciates your having spoken to my mother before making your love known to her. That action has disposed her in your favor. Perhaps it may interest you to know that. But at any rate, come with me right away."</p>
<p>I danced with joy, and ran madly about, or rather, flew.</p>
<p>I was soon at M. Dormeuil's, and when I went in I found him with his wife; Ernestine was in her room, and I was received with pleasant laughter.</p>
<p>"Come, my friend," the father said to me, "you wish to become our son, and we desire it too, because you seem to us worthy of the treasure we would entrust to you, and if she consents, you shall be happy. Your growing love did not escape me, and I have followed it in all its phases and seen with pleasure that it was pure, honest, and delicate." He rang, and a servant appeared.</p>
<p>"Tell my daughter to come down."</p>
<p>A moment later Ernestine appeared, and I rose; the sight of me evidently caused her some emotion, for she blushed.</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle, may I interpret as favorable that flush which does not escape me? I have dared to raise my eyes to yours, to aspire to a happiness beyond my expectation, of which I shall make myself worthy; for the desire to please you makes a man capable of anything. Your parents would perhaps give me their best wishes if you were to join yours to them. Speak, and if you would know what my deportment toward you will be, should you deign to accept my homage, I shall take M. Dormeuil for a model."</p>
<p>Ernestine seemed to wish to speak and yet not to. I seized her hand.</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle, decide my fate."</p>
<p>"Come, daughter," said her father, "I authorize you to answer; but search your heart before doing so."</p>
<p>Ernestine said: "Sir, your choice does me honor, it flatters me, perhaps. Though I do full justice to your good qualities, and your delicate deportment proves that you merit such a distinction, I would like to remind you, that as yet we hardly know each other well enough to make such a momentous decision without reflection. I do indeed believe in the sincerity of your sentiments, of your love; but I cannot tell you yet that I share them. Leave me some time to myself, and since you have the permission of my parents, you can speak to me of your esteem, of…,” she hesitated, and I added, "of your love."</p>
<p>"Leave your happiness to me, for if it depends on my wishes you will soon know."</p>
<p>I took her hand, pressed it to my breast and to my lips. I was fairly drunk, and beside myself with joy.</p>
<p>"Well, well, " said M. Dormeuil, "how foolish lovers are!" And turning to his wife, said "Was I so, darling?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear."</p>
<p>"Then I excuse him. Come, my dear Edmund, and may Ernestine soon make it possible that we may have another son."</p>
<p>Dormeuil came up to me. "My dear friend, " he said, grasping my hand, "may you soon be my brother—that is my dearest wish."</p>
<p>Ernestine was standing near her father, and a sweet security seemed to spread over her whole being.</p>
<p>At last, I was able to say that I made daily progress in her affections, and she soon shared my love. My attentions, my courtesies, and my constancy, convinced her that she was my only love, and the reports they had of me being favorable, at the end of six months I became Ernestine's husband.</p>
<p>I have no words to express my happiness, and every day since that memorable hour I say, "She is mine," and I reproach myself for having the slightest desire of which she is not the whole object. We were in a very heaven of bliss, and since I was staying with the Dormeuils, we were as one family. My Colonel, who had just been made a General, and who had, at the time of my marriage been particularly kind to me, added his requests to the claims which I might have to secure his regiment for me, in which I soon had young Dormeuil, much to the delight of Ernestine and our parents.</p>
